<p class="subtitle"><a name="about">About the site</a></p>
<p>This website, inaugurated on August 2022, compiles a series of contents, professional and of another type, that I have been producing since 2000 and that I have presented online through a good number of platforms and spaces, especially blogs, digital magazines and columns, as well as social networks. At the same time, it serves as a platform for present and future publications within my areas of interest.</p>
<p>In the <a href="#pubs" title="Publications" alt="Publications">publications</a> section, I give an account of platforms, archives and other storage spaces for my intellectual production, while in my <a href="#blogs" title="Blogs" alt="Blogs">blogs</a> I continue to write periodically.</p>
<p>All contents related to music and (ethno)musicology have been moved to the website <a href="https://www.instru-mentarium.org/2019/12/instrumentarium-in-english-homepage.html" target="_blank" alt="Instrumentarium" title="Instrumentarium"><i>Instrumentarium</i></a> (mostly in Spanish).</p>

<p>The site hosts a blog in Spanish on <a href="blog.html" title="Blog Bitácora de un bibliotecario" alt="Blog Bitácora de un bibliotecario">libraries and archives</a>. There is also a space in English, hosted on Medium: <a href="https://medium.com/libraries-in-the-margins" target="_blank" title="Libraries in the margins" alt="Libraries in the margins"><i>Libraries in the margins</i></a>.</p>

<p class="subtitle"><a name="author">The author</a></p>
<p>
I am a multifaceted professional with 25 years of experience, and a native of Puerto de Santa María de los Buenos Aires (1973). I became a librarian in 1999 and, in 2004, a graduate in Library Science and Documentation at the National University of Córdoba (Argentina). There I also studied Biology and History (Anthropology and Archaeology), although long before that I had studied Marine Sciences at the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (Spain). After a long and varied professional career (which includes a specialization in Epistemologies of the South, a master's degree in Historical Archiving and Memory, and diplomas, master's and doctoral degrees in progress), since 2024 I live between Panama (where I supervise the library of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute) and Bogotá (Colombia), where I work as a consultant in a wide variety of knowledge and memory management and content production projects. </p>
<p>
I specialize in metadata, Digital Asset Management, digital preservation, data management and curation, programming, artificial intelligence and IT solutions. As a teacher, researcher, lecturer and popular writer, I work with natural sciences, traditional knowledge, cultural heritage, memory and identity, sounds and silences, musical instruments, audiovisual collections and musical bibliographic research, and with the dialogue between libraries, archives and museums to build new knowledge and recover old stories. </p>
<p>
Throughout my career I have acquired extensive experience in critical and social librarianship; in working with libraries on the margins; in the management of traditional knowledge, oral tradition and endangered sounds (languages and music); and in the design of library services for indigenous societies and other "subaltern" groups. In addition to the traditional roles in information science, I also work with knowledge classification, semantic web, and construction of documentary languages, vocabularies, ontologies and metadata. And to all that I add my work with library design and library services, collection management, decolonization, grassroots library development (rural, neighborhood, community, school, popular) and mobile libraries, open access, copyright / copyleft, open source in librarianship (DSpace, Koha, OJS3), non-European book history, reading promotion, digital humanities and qualitative research. </p>
<p>
I understand and defend the library as a committed space of activism and socio-political militancy, and of cultural, identity and collective resistance. </p>
<p>
My work in the Galapagos Islands (2018-2022) linked me to fields such as history and memory of science, open science, e-research, biodiversity and environmental conservation, citizen science, biomimicry, sustainability and degrowth, as well as knowledge mobilization, communication, outreach and environmental education, and preservation, conservation and digitization of heritage collections. </p>
<p>
Since 2004 I have been part of several IFLA sections and groups, I have worked with the CDU Consortium (Universal Decimal Classification), I participate in several editorial committees and digital spaces for research and debate, I give classes and lectures, and I write outreach texts on the topics of my interest, which I publish through my independent publishing house El Zorro de Abajo Editora (formerly Wayrachaki Editora). </p>
<p>
In addition to being a librarian, I am a musician: a multi-instrumentalist acceptable at everything and virtuoso at nothing, a performer of traditional Latin American and European music. I am interested in the sounds and silences of the world, and the many stories they tell, and I feel a special inclination towards the relationship of that sound heritage with memory and identity. I research and share the results through a wide series of digital outreach publications, compose and perform music, build instruments, explore other sound horizons and create new personal research projects online. </p>
<p>
Beyond libraries and music, I am a proofreader, translator and editorial designer, an old print worker, an avid language learner, a frustrated fiction writer, a blogger with 20 years of experience behind me, a Wikipedian and Esperantist, an apprentice citizen scientist, a cartoonist and photographer, and a puppet builder. </p>

<p class="subtitle"><a name="contact">Contact & networks</a></p>
<p>My contact email is edgardocivallero (@) gmail (.) com. I may also be found at several social networks, whose direct accesses are presented in the bar at the bottom of this page (mostly in Spanish).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subtitle"><a name="pubs">Publications, platforms, & academic networks</a></p> 
<p>
All my publications, including digital books, articles, conferences, courses, pre-prints, compilations of blog posts and informative texts, are stored in <a href="https://archive.org/details/@ecivallero" target="_blank" title="Archive.org" alt="Archive.org">Archive.org</a>, in the Argentinean open-access repository <a href="https://www.aacademica.org/edgardo.civallero" target="_blank" title="Acta Académica" alt="Acta Académica">Acta Académica</a>, and in the folder "Publicaciones" of my space in <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qFxKgIsZBTJw5j_xFkgLuCZPi7_MMZVR?usp=sharing" target="_blank" title="GoogleDrive" alt="GoogleDrive">GoogleDrive</a>.</p>
<p>A handful of those texts are also in the open access archive <a href="https://repository.arizona.edu/browse?value=Civallero%2C+Edgardo&type=author" target="_blank" title="DLIST" alt="DLIST">DLIST</a>, of the University of Arizona (USA). And although in the past all my materials were presented on E-LIS, they were removed from there around 2016 due to strong differences with the structure and management model of that space.</p>
<p>Among my publications, there are <a href="libros01.html" alt="Digital books on indigenous libraries" title="Digital books on indigenous libraries">digital books</a> on indigenous libraries (link in Spanish); digital books on music and musical instruments <a href="https://www.instru-mentarium.org/2022/10/instrumentarium-libros-digitales-sobre.html" target="_blank" alt="digital books on music" title="digital books on music">in Spanish</a> and <a href="https://www.instru-mentarium.org/2022/10/instrumentarium-digital-books-on-music.html" target="_blank" alt="Digital books on music" title="Digital books on music">in English</a>; <a href="https://www.instru-mentarium.org/2022/10/instrumentarium-articulos-sobre-musica.html" target="_blank" alt="Articles on music" title="Articles on music">articles</a> on music and musical instruments (link in Spanish); <a href="libros03.html" alt="Photography books" title="Photography books">photography books</a> (link in Spanish); and a series of <a href="libros02.html" alt="Fiction works" title="Fiction works">fiction works</a> (link in Spanish).</p>
<p>From 2007 to 2022, a good part of my digital books were published through my old independent publishing house Wayrachaki Editora, a personal initiative which today is continued by <a href="editorial.html" title="El Zorro de Abajo Editora" alt="El Zorro de Abajo Editora">El Zorro de Abajo Editora</a> (link in Spanish).</p>
<p>
Most of my intellectual production is also stored on three platforms that are popular but somewhat debated due to their working model: <a href="http://issuu.com/edgardo-civallero/" target="_blank" title="Issuu" alt="Issuu">Issuu</a>, <a href="https://es.scribd.com/edcivallero" target="_blank" title="Scribd" alt="Scribd">Scribd</a> and <a href="http://es.calameo.com/accounts/4163651" target="_blank" title="Calameo" alt="Calameo">Calaméo</a>.</p>
<p>
I also belong to a number of academic networks. In three of them I present and share, as in those mentioned above, most of my publications: <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MbiuWvUAAAAJ" target="_blank" title="Google Scholar" alt="Google Scholar">Google Scholar</a>, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Edgardo_Civallero" target="_blank" title="Research Gate" alt="Research Gate">Research Gate</a> and <a href="https://independent.academia.edu/EdCivallero" target="_blank" title="Academia.edu" alt="Academia.edu">Academia.edu</a>. These have also been strongly debated for their ethical principles and action models; however, they present a series of utilities that are beneficial.</p>
<p>
Finally, I participate in other academic-professional structures, such as <a href="https://www.webofscience.com/wos/author/record/656150" target="_blank" title="Web of Science" alt="Web of Science">Web of Science</a>, <a href="https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56254900700" target="_blank" title="Scopus" alt="Scopus">Scopus</a>, <a href="https://www.mendeley.com/search/?page=1&query=edgardo%20civallero" target="_blank" title="Mendeley" alt="Mendeley">Mendeley</a> and <a href="https://www.zotero.org/edgardocivallero" target="_blank" title="Zotero" alt="Zotero">Zotero</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subtitle"><a name="activities">Activities</a></p>
<p>I develop my LIS-related teaching work (presential and virtual instances) around most of the topics that make up conventional Library & Information Sciences (i.e., those taught in a standard university curriculum). I add the most social facets of the profession (critical and "trench" libraries, libraries "in the margins"), memory-related activities (oral tradition, traditional knowledge), areas of contact between libraries / information and biological and environmental sciences, and the world of data management.</p>
<p>Among the potential activities to be developed (courses, workshops and / or seminars) I offer the "Librarianship for non-librarians" series (with a wide selection of contents, from acquisition to cataloging and classification, through policy design and reading promotion), the "Trench libraries" series (for unconventional libraries or those working in complex spaces), the "Decolonizing libraries" series (addressing library work from the <i>Epistemologías del Sur</i> / Southern Epistemologies' perspective), the "Libraries and biosphere" series (addressing citizen science, sustainability, growth, "green" libraries, Agenda 2030) and the "Libraries from scratch" series (for those starting a library). I also work with ontologies and thesaurus building, knowledge classification, data management and semantic web.</p>
<p>Finally, I teach courses, workshops and / or seminars on collection and management of oral tradition and threatened sounds (languages and music, especially indigenous) and the organization of library services for indigenous societies and "minority" populations.</p>
<p>For further details, please <a href="#contact" alt="Contact" title="Contact">contact me</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subtitle"><a name="services">Services</a></p>
<p>I provide professional consulting services on topics related to the organization of bibliographic and informative collections (physical and virtual), document analysis and classification of knowledge, linked data, semantic web, data resource management, digital curation, data visualization, building of ontologies, vocabularies and thesauri (especially those related to pure and natural sciences, anthropology and history), planning of information services and design of virtual libraries (both for scientific-academic and business environments), data management, urban memory, development of mobile library services (especially for rural environments and users), cultural heritage management (especially indigenous and rural), management of sound collections (threatened languages, traditional music) and oral expressions, and organization of bioinformation and biological collections. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subtitle"><a name="history">History</a></p>
<p>I began my journey in the network of networks with "Bitácora de un bibliotecario", which began operating on December 2, 2004 as one of the first Latin American / Spanish-language weblogs on libraries and librarians. At that time I had just finished my degree in Library Science and Documentation, I had a few years of work experience behind me and I was looking into a still unknown academic world, so in those posts I reflected my concerns and my discoveries, my illusions and my disappointments, my struggles and my encounters. Between 2005 and 2008 I kept an English version in parallel, "The log of a librarian". As of 2009, the posts were sparse, and in 2014 I decided to close the old "Bitacora..." and, with it, a period of my personal and professional life.</p>
<p>With the perspective provided by the years and the path traveled and with the learning accumulated in my backpack, in 2015 I opened a new blog, simply titled "Bibliotecario", heir to the previous one and continuation of many of its works, of many of its ideas and all its values. That space was maintained until 2022. At the same time, in parallel, I developed another series of blogs related to library sciences but very specialized, including the first spaces on indigenous libraries ("Bibliotecas y pueblos originarios", "Bibliotecas indígenas"), orality ("Tradición oral") and indigenous languages ("Palabra indígena").</p>
<p>In addition, I worked on topics related to ethnomusicology, traditional sounds and musical instruments, and I did that in spaces such as "Bitácora de un músico", "Un Sur de sonidos", "Sonidos de Abya Yala", "Vientos de tierra de vientos" (a self-produced Andean music CD) and "Sonidos y silencios". That area had other spaces in parallel, such as the digital magazine of Andean music and culture "Tierra de vientos" or the "Aula abierta de música tradicional".</p>
<p>Finally, as a writer I kept a space called "Bitácora de un escritor", and individual blogs for my different literary works, including "Crónicas de la Serpiente Emplumada", "Espíritus del Viento" and "El Ekeko ".</p>
<p>The enormous multiplicity of spaces was difficult to maintain, and they were progressively reduced, until I managed to concentrate all the contents on this site, where the products are presented in their plural context, intertwining and dialoguing with each other.</p>
