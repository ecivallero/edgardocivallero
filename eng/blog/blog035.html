This post is part of a series that reviews decolonialism in libraries, archives and other similar spaces, from the perspective of the Global South and the margins, and how colonialism affects collections, staffing, services, activities, policies, and results. Check all the posts in this section's <a href="../blog.html" title="Blog">index</a>.</p>

<p><b>
Introduction</b></p>
<p>
Libraries have historically been shaped by Western paradigms, presenting knowledge through the lens of dominant cultures. The colonial legacy that permeates library collections has often led to the silencing of voices and perspectives from the Global South, Indigenous communities, and other marginalized groups. As part of the decolonial movement, libraries must actively work to shift this dynamic by raising non-Western voices and formats that have been pushed to the margins for centuries. </p>
<p>
This post will explore why it is vital to highlight non-Western perspectives and materials in libraries, how to identify gaps in collections, and ways to create spaces where these voices and documents can not only exist but thrive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>
The Colonial Legacy in Libraries</b></p>
<p>
Colonialism did not only impact borders, economies, and cultures; it also reshaped knowledge systems. Western institutions, including libraries, have long operated as instruments of colonialism, where knowledge was collected, cataloged, and often distorted through a Eurocentric framework. This resulted in the marginalization of knowledge from cultures across Africa, Asia, Latin America, and Indigenous communities (and even rural, traditional European societies). When we think about library collections, we must acknowledge that non-Western knowledge systems were often either ignored, misrepresented, or reduced to secondary status.</p>
<p>
The colonial era brought with it the widespread dissemination of Western ideas and the suppression of different knowledge structures. Libraries, like many other institutions, were complicit in this process, often collecting and preserving Western-produced materials while neglecting or discrediting non-Western sources. For example, while many library collections feature extensive volumes (books and other printed materials) on European history, philosophy, and literature, they may lack materials on Indigenous worldviews, African epistemologies, or Asian traditions of knowledge. When these perspectives are present, they are often filtered through a Western lens, perpetuating a distorted view of non-Western cultures.</p>
<p>
To undo this damage, libraries must first recognize this legacy and actively work to diversify their collections, ensuring that they reflect the full spectrum of human knowledge and experience. By doing so, libraries can challenge the global dominance of Western ideals and instead celebrate the rich diversity of intellectual traditions that have often been excluded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>
The Importance of Non-Western Perspectives</b></p>
<p>
Highlighting non-Western perspectives is not merely an exercise in diversity but a necessary step toward intellectual justice. Non-Western epistemes (knowledge systems) offer unique ways of thinking, being, and knowing that have been suppressed or overlooked. In contrast to the individualistic, capitalist-driven narratives often promoted in the West, many non-Western systems of thought prioritize community, the environment, and holistic understandings of life.</p>
<p>
For example, many Indigenous knowledge systems, such as those practiced by Native American and Aboriginal Australian communities, focus on cyclical understandings of time, land stewardship, and relational knowledge. These systems place significant emphasis on oral traditions and pictorial materials, where stories, teachings, and ceremonies are passed down through generations. In many cases, this knowledge is not just informational but relational, interconnected with spiritual, ecological, and social systems.</p>
<p>
Furthermore, African epistemologies offer rich traditions of communal learning, oral history, and cosmologies that stand in stark contrast to Western individualism and scientific rationalism. For example, the (now widely known) concept of Ubuntu, which emphasizes interconnectedness, compassion, and humanity, offers a profound counter-narrative to Western capitalist ideals of competition and self-interest. By elevating these perspectives, libraries can provide the public with tools to challenge unsustainable systems and empower new solutions to global challenges.</p>
<p>
In today's world, where the sustainability of both human societies and the natural environment is under threat, the knowledge held by these non-Western communities has never been more relevant. Non-Western knowledge systems often emphasize harmony with nature, social responsibility, and long-term environmental sustainability—concepts that could guide solutions to contemporary global crises, such as climate change and inequality.</p>
<p>
By raising non-Western voices, libraries contribute to creating a more inclusive, rich, and diverse intellectual landscape. These voices provide alternative ways of understanding the world, offering invaluable insights into human existence and society. It's essential that libraries not only present these perspectives but also advocate for their centrality in global discussions on knowledge and development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>
Actions Libraries Can Take</b></p>
<p>
To raise non-Western voices, libraries first need to identify where the gaps in their collections lie. Are the books, articles, and media available representative of diverse global perspectives? Are Indigenous or African authors marginalized in favor of Western authors? Do archives and collections contain materials from formerly colonized countries? Do they include different materials, like baskets, textiles, sculptures or other kind of documents? Undertaking this audit is essential for librarians who seek to diversify the narratives present within their institutions. Additionally, such audits should go beyond content and examine how these voices are represented within library cataloging systems. Are Indigenous perspectives categorized as "folklore" or "ethnography," which can devalue the significance of these cultures and traditions? Are traditional narratives and stories still labelled as "myths"? Librarians should work to correct these gaps by actively seeking out and acquiring materials that represent underrepresented regions and cultures. This could involve collaborating with local and international organizations that focus on Indigenous, African, and other non-Western knowledge production.</p>
<p>
One of the most direct ways libraries can raise non-Western voices is through acquisition policies that intentionally include texts from underrepresented regions and cultures. Librarians must also be conscious of the intersectionality within these communities — acknowledging that the experiences of women, queer individuals, and other marginalized groups within non-Western cultures are often neglected. For example, acquiring works by Black women authors from the Global South or Indigenous authors writing in native languages can help to ensure that more nuanced and diverse perspectives are included in the collection. While Western publishers and academic presses still dominate the global book market, libraries can take active steps to support publishers from non-Western countries or small independent presses that focus on global narratives outside of the Western canon. Partnerships with local community organizations, publishers, and international bodies can also expand the breadth of materials available.</p>
<p>
Libraries can also create partnerships with community organizations, cultural institutions, and international networks to amplify non-Western voices. This could involve working with cultural centers to co-curate exhibitions or partnering with local immigrant and refugee groups to create content that reflects their stories and histories. Furthermore, promoting open-access resources and digital archives from non-Western perspectives can democratize access to knowledge and support international collaboration.</p>
<p>
They can also hold events and programs that highlight non-Western traditions, from literature readings and art exhibitions to film screenings and lectures. These events should not just showcase non-Western art, but also allow for discussions that contextualize the significance of these works within their cultural framework. Advocacy for these initiatives within and outside of the library community is essential for shifting public perceptions and influencing library policy.</p>
<p>
Finally, one significant barrier to presenting non-Western voices is the way in which collections are organized. Many cataloging and classification systems, such as Dewey Decimal or Library of Congress Subject Headings, are deeply rooted in Western epistemology. Classifications of African or Indigenous knowledge have often been limited to stereotypical or colonial lenses. Libraries must experiment with alternatives, revising classification schemes to reflect a more diverse and culturally appropriate approach to organizing knowledge. Additionally, librarians should actively engage with non-Western scholars, knowledge keepers, and community leaders to develop culturally sensitive metadata, cataloging practices, and new forms of indexing that reflect diverse worldviews.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>
Raising Non-Western Voices for the Future</b></p>
<p>
In raising non-Western voices and materials from the ashes of colonialism, libraries are not just rectifying historical wrongs but shaping a future where diverse perspectives can lead the charge in solving humanity's most pressing challenges. By highlighting the voices and knowledge systems that were once suppressed, libraries contribute to the creation of a more inclusive, equitable, and sustainable world. These efforts are not simply academic; they are deeply connected to the ongoing struggle for justice, reconciliation, and respect for all cultures. The decolonization of libraries is an essential part of the global effort to build a more just and inclusive world.</p>
<p>
Libraries, as cultural institutions, have a responsibility not only to reflect but to amplify the voices of those who have been historically marginalized. Through intentional collection strategies, advocacy, and collaboration with underrepresented communities, libraries can lead the way in fostering a world where knowledge is truly shared and inclusive.</p>
