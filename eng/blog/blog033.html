<p class="subtitle">Collaborating with Underrepresented Communities</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p class="notainicial">
This post is part of a series that reviews decolonialism in libraries, archives and other similar spaces, from the perspective of the Global South and the margins, and how colonialism affects collections, staffing, services, activities, policies, and results. Check all the posts in this section's <a href="../blog.html" title="Blog" alt="Blog">index</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>
Introduction</b></p>
<p>
Libraries have been considered (and have been, in most cases) spaces for information, education and community outreach. But what happens when such spaces truly engage with the communities they serve, particularly those that have been historically marginalized or underrepresented? As stewards of knowledge and memory, libraries have a unique responsibility to ensure that those voices are not only heard, but also protected and amplified. </p>
<p>
In this post, I explore the importance of libraries as allies in marginalized communities' struggles for representation, and how we can actively engage with underrepresented voices to ensure our collections reflect the richness and diversity of the societies we serve. Collaboration is key in this effort — by partnering with those on the margins, libraries can challenge exclusionary practices and contribute to creating a more inclusive knowledge ecosystem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>
The Marginalization of Certain Narratives</b></p>
<p>
Historically, libraries have often been complicit in reinforcing dominant narratives that have sidelined the experiences, cultures, and histories of marginalized groups. These groups include, but are not limited to, Indigenous peoples, communities "of color", LGBTQ+ populations, and the economically disadvantaged. A combination of systemic barriers and historical exclusion has meant that the contributions and lived experiences of these and many other communities have been either underrepresented or misrepresented in library collections and systems.</p>
<p>
For instance, in many traditional Western libraries, Indigenous knowledge and perspectives have been either overlooked or framed through a colonial lens. Indigenous knowledge —often oral, relational, and deeply rooted in specific geographies and worldviews— has historically been excluded from library cataloging systems dominated by written Western forms of knowledge. As a result, communities that hold and pass on this knowledge are frequently denied access to their own histories, voices, and intellectual heritage.</p>
<p>
The rise of social justice movements such as Black Lives Matter and Indigenous rights movements has highlighted the urgent need to reconsider whose voices are prioritized in cultural institutions, including libraries. It's crucial for libraries to acknowledge that everybody must be allowed to tell their own stories, and that libraries are more than mere repositories — they are platforms for knowledge creation, exchange, and validation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>
The Role of Libraries as Allies</b></p>
<p>
The concept of the library as an ally in marginalized communities means that we need to shift our perspective from passive information providers to active collaborators in the fight for equity and representation. The question for librarians and cultural institutions is no longer just "What can we do for these communities?" but "How can we work with them to amplify their voices and ensure their narratives are not only included but are central to the story we tell?"</p>
<p>
Libraries are increasingly being called to decolonize their practices — not only in terms of collections but in the relationships they build with communities. This involves creating space for dialogue, sharing power, and building trust with those who have been systematically excluded from knowledge systems.</p>
<p>
Active engagement with marginalized groups is a crucial first step. This may involve outreach initiatives, community-driven programming, and partnerships with local organizations that serve underrepresented communities. Libraries should facilitate spaces where these groups can share their stories, whether through oral histories, storytelling events, or collaborative research projects.</p>
<p>
Additionally, one of the most effective ways libraries can collaborate with marginalized communities is through the co-creation of resources. Instead of simply curating content that speaks to these communities' experiences, libraries should invite community members to create content that represents their lived realities. This includes the digitization of local knowledge, archives, and personal narratives that have traditionally been overlooked.</p>
<p>
Finally, libraries can also be powerful platforms for marginalized voices by providing access to space, technology, and tools that allow community members to tell their own stories. Digital storytelling workshops, podcasting spaces, and video production resources can empower communities to produce their own content in their own terms, which can then be shared and preserved by the library.</p>
<p>
To truly empower marginalized communities, libraries must recognize that working within traditional Western systems is not enough — they need to help develop new tools, new structures, and new ways of engaging that center the voices and needs of the communities they serve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>
Challenges and Opportunities in Allyship</b></p>
<p>
Despite the progress libraries have made in recent years, significant challenges remain when it comes to engaging with underrepresented communities. Many libraries still operate within frameworks that were designed by and for dominant, often white, Western cultures. These frameworks may not always be conducive to the needs of marginalized groups, and libraries may struggle to build trust or engage meaningfully with communities that have been historically harmed by cultural institutions.</p>
<p>
One of the most significant challenges libraries face is building trust with communities that have been excluded from or harmed by dominant institutions. The historical legacy of exploitation, misrepresentation, and systemic discrimination has created a wariness of institutional spaces like libraries. For many marginalized communities, the library may represent another iteration of colonial power structures, so it is essential for libraries to demonstrate genuine commitment to listening, collaborating, and co-creating knowledge.</p>
<p>
Libraries that embrace the role of ally can become hubs of community empowerment, transformation, and healing. By working with marginalized communities, libraries have the chance to break down the walls that have traditionally separated "institutions" from "communities," building bridges of solidarity that can transform not only the library's collections and services but also the community's relationship to knowledge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>
Conclusion</b></p>
<p>
Libraries, at their best, are places of inclusivity, connection, and empowerment. But this potential can only be realized if libraries are proactive in working alongside underrepresented communities to decolonize their practices and embrace new, more equitable ways of serving all patrons. Libraries must go beyond tokenism and actively engage with marginalized groups to make their voices a central part of the narrative. As allies in the struggle for representation, libraries can help shape a more just and inclusive society: one where the knowledge of all people is valued, preserved, and shared on equal footing.</p>
<p>
If libraries are to truly fulfill their role as institutions of knowledge and education, they must commit to centering the margins — because the future of knowledge belongs to everyone, not just the privileged few.</p>

I know that they can burn books, raze libraries, ban languages, banish beliefs, erase pasts, erase presents, order futures, torture and execute people. But I also know that they have not yet discovered how to kill the intangible and luminous body of an idea, a dream, or a hope (E. Civallero.
