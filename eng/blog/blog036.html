<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>
Introduction</b></p>
<p>
Cataloging is more than just a technical process — it's an act of shaping how we understand and interact with knowledge. As the backbone of library systems, cataloging determines how resources are organized, accessed, and ultimately interpreted by users.</p>
<p>
For decades, cataloging standards such as Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) and Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) have been essential in organizing knowledge. However, these systems have often been developed and structured within a Eurocentric framework, reflecting Western ideologies and ignoring the richness and complexity of non-Western, Indigenous, and marginalized knowledge systems.</p>
<p>
While these traditional standards have served libraries well in the past, the global landscape of knowledge is rapidly evolving, and the need for inclusive practices in cataloging has never been more urgent. By rethinking cataloging from a decolonial perspective, libraries have the opportunity to build systems that not only reflect the diversity of global knowledge but also affirm the value of all cultures and traditions. </p>
<p>
Culturally relevant cataloging practices are not just a matter of adding diverse resources to a collection; they are about ensuring that these resources are properly categorized, accessible, and treated with the respect they deserve. This post will explore the importance of culturally relevant cataloging, the biases inherent in traditional systems, and the steps libraries can take to create more inclusive, equitable knowledge structures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>
The Colonial Impact on Cataloging</b></p>
<p>
Historically, cataloging practices have been shaped by Western academic and cultural norms, which have dominated knowledge systems for centuries. Schemes like DDC and LCSH were designed with a Eurocentric view of knowledge, categorizing and classifying resources based on Western concepts, ideologies, and epistemologies. This bias is embedded in their very structure. An example: non-Western and Indigenous knowledge systems are often categorized as "mythology," "folklore," or even "primitive cultures," reinforcing the notion that these knowledge systems are inferior or secondary to Western scientific or historical information.</p>
<p>
Such classifications have a profound impact on how knowledge is perceived and treated. By relegating non-Western perspectives to marginal categories, these cataloging systems perpetuate a hierarchy that privileges Western views while silencing others. The colonial legacy of this structure continues to shape how libraries collect, organize, and present materials, often leaving Indigenous, African, Asian, and Latin American knowledge unrepresented, misunderstood, or miscategorized.</p>
<p>
This colonial influence is not merely a historical artifact; it is still present today in many libraries. And while libraries in general have made strides toward diversifying their collections, the cataloging of those materials often still follows outdated and biased practices, limiting access to authentic, self-represented materials from non-Western and Indigenous cultures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>
The Need for Culturally Relevant Cataloging</b></p>
<p>
Culturally relevant cataloging is critical for libraries that aim to be inclusive, equitable, and representative of the global diversity of knowledge. When cataloging practices are rooted in cultural sensitivity, they not only provide more accurate representation of global knowledge but also empower marginalized communities to see their cultures and histories reflected in library collections. More than a technical adjustment, it's a fundamental shift in how libraries understand and value knowledge.</p>
<p>
A central component of culturally relevant cataloging is challenging the historical dominance of Western narratives. By revisiting the terms, categories, and systems used to classify knowledge, libraries can dismantle the Eurocentric biases that have long shaped library practices. This includes not only reevaluating the categories in which non-Western and Indigenous materials are placed but also rethinking the language used in cataloging. For instance, terms like "myth," "folklore," or "superstition" can be replaced with more respectful and accurate descriptors such as "Indigenous traditions" or "traditional knowledge."</p>
<p>
Adopting culturally relevant cataloging practices also enhances the accessibility of collections for diverse users. When materials are categorized in a way that respects the cultural and intellectual contexts from which they originate, users are more likely to engage with these resources in meaningful ways. This also ensures that all users —regardless of their background— can find knowledge that speaks to their own experiences and histories. For example, instead of labeling African oral traditions as "oral literature," cataloging them as "African storytelling traditions" allows for a more respectful and accurate representation of these rich cultural practices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>
Challenges in Implementing Culturally Relevant Cataloging</b></p>
<p>
Despite the clear need for reform, there are several challenges to implementing culturally relevant cataloging practices. The biggest hurdle is the dominance of existing cataloging systems. The Dewey Decimal Classification system and Library of Congress Subject Headings are so deeply ingrained in library practice that any attempt to revise or replace them is met with resistance. Librarians may feel constrained by institutional budgets, training, and a lack of sufficient alternatives.</p>
<p>
One challenge in particular is the lack of standardized, globally recognized systems that can replace the Western-centric ones. While some initiatives, such as the Indigenous Classification System, have been proposed to provide more culturally sensitive alternatives, they are not widely adopted. Moreover, many libraries may feel the cost and complexity of transitioning to new systems is too high, especially when faced with budget cuts or limited resources.</p>
<p>
Another significant challenge is the inherent difficulty in reconciling the universal nature of library classification systems with the specific, localized knowledge that they often overlook. Many non-Western cultures do not adhere to the Western conception of knowledge, which is typically organized in hierarchical, linear categories. Non-Western systems of knowledge tend to be more fluid, holistic, and interconnected, which can make it difficult to categorize using standardized systems like DDC or LCSH. As a result, catalogers must navigate the tension between the universality of cataloging systems and the diversity of knowledge that exists around the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>
Steps Toward Culturally Relevant Cataloging Practices</b></p>
<p>
Libraries should begin by evaluating the subject headings used in their cataloging systems, particularly those that deal with non-Western or marginalized knowledge. For example, resources on Indigenous cultures should not be relegated to categories like "primitive" or "mythology." Instead, libraries can use more respectful and contextually appropriate terms like "Indigenous cultures" or "Native wisdom." This kind of rethinking and reclassification helps to recognize the value of non-Western knowledge on its own terms, rather than through a Eurocentric lens.</p>
<p>
One plausible option is to develop localized classification systems that reflect the specific cultures and traditions of the communities being served. Libraries working with Indigenous populations could develop a classification schedule that accounts for local wisdom, spiritual practices, and ecological understanding. These systems could then be integrated into broader cataloging schemes like DDC or LCSH, allowing librarians to respect cultural specificity while still maintaining consistency across collections.</p>
<p>
Libraries must prioritize collaboration with the communities they serve. Engaging with Indigenous groups, ethnic minorities, and other marginalized communities ensures that their perspectives are accurately represented in the cataloging process. This might involve working with community leaders and knowledge keepers to ensure that the library's classification practices align with local cultural values — a collaboration aimed at ensuring that knowledge is not imposed upon these communities but is understood and interpreted within its cultural context.</p>
<p>
When appropriate, librarians and catalogers should receive training in cultural competency and decolonial practices. This training should address the history of colonization in library science, provide insights into the epistemologies of non-Western cultures, and help catalogers navigate the complexities of decolonizing knowledge systems. It should be an ongoing process, as cultural knowledge is always evolving, and cataloging practices must be dynamic in order to adapt to new understandings.</p>
<p>
Libraries can also use technology to enhance culturally relevant cataloging practices. Digital resources, metadata standards, and online classification tools can help to create more adaptable and inclusive cataloging frameworks. Through technology, libraries can enhance the ability to categorize knowledge from diverse cultural contexts without losing the integrity of the knowledge itself.</p>
<p>
Cataloging reform should also be accompanied by changes in collection development policies. Librarians should prioritize the inclusion of diverse materials and ensure that they are appropriately categorized. Libraries, for example, could focus on collecting Indigenous literature, art, and historical resources, and then ensuring that these materials are cataloged in ways that reflect their cultural significance. This practice not only amplifies marginalized voices but also challenges the colonial legacy embedded in library collections.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>
Conclusion</b></p>
<p>
Redefining cataloging standards is an essential aspect of creating libraries that are reflective of the world's intellectual diversity. As we move forward, libraries must rethink traditional cataloging systems and adopt culturally relevant practices that honor the knowledge systems of all cultures, especially those that have been historically marginalized. </p>
<p>
The act of cataloging is not a neutral or purely technical process; it is a powerful form of knowledge management that shapes how the world sees different cultures and traditions. Through the reevaluation and the decolonization of cataloging practices, libraries can affirm the worth of diverse knowledge systems and contribute to the creation of more equitable and inclusive information environments. The journey to redefine knowledge begins with the catalog, and libraries are well-positioned to lead the way.</p>
