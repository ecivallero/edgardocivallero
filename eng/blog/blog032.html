<p class="subtitle">Assessing Existing Collections for Colonial Bias</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p class="notainicial">
This post is part of a series that reviews decolonialism in libraries, archives and other similar spaces, from the perspective of the Global South and the margins, and how colonialism affects collections, staffing, services, activities, policies, and results. Check all the posts in this section's <a href="../blog.html" title="Blog" alt="Blog">index</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>
Introduction</b></p>
<p>
As libraries, we have an important role in shaping how knowledge and memory are collected, managed, shared, accessed, and preserved. However, this responsibility extends beyond simply organizing documents or making information available — it requires an ongoing commitment to critically assess the systems that influence the way knowledge is classified, stored, and disseminated. Are our collections part of the problem? </p>
<p>
In this post, I'll examine how the legacy of colonialism still subtly —and sometimes not so subtly— permeates our library collections, and the crucial role libraries must play in identifying and dismantling these colonial biases. Colonialism's influence on libraries is not always immediately visible, but the framework that underpins the materials we collect, the knowledge we prioritize, and the perspectives we elevate reflects centuries of cultural dominance and marginalization. </p>
<p>
How colonial history continues to shape library collections? What steps librarians can take to challenge and correct these enduring biases?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>
The Silent Legacy of Colonialism in Library Collections</b></p>
<p>
Colonialism wasn't just about territorial conquest — it was also about the control and manipulation of knowledge. European colonial powers did not only seize land and resources; they also imposed their own worldview, which was seen as superior and more "civilized," on the colonized peoples. Central to this imperial project was the imposition of European systems of knowledge and categorization — whether that be in terms of science, literature, history, or culture.</p>
<p>
Libraries, historically rooted in Western traditions, have often unwittingly perpetuated this colonial legacy. The Eurocentric lens through which we organize, classify, and preserve knowledge continues to shape the resources we provide. These biases are not only visible in the content of collections but also in the systems we use to categorize and label materials, often disregarding the diverse ways that knowledge is created, understood, and transmitted in different cultures.</p>
<p>
Colonialism in libraries is not confined to a past event — it is an ongoing process, sustained by the systems and structures that continue to uphold Western dominance in the field of knowledge. Libraries that were built on colonial foundations reflect these biases by prioritizing certain worldviews while erasing others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>
Unpacking Colonial Bias: What Does It Look Like in Your Collections?</b></p>
<p>
Recognizing colonial bias is the first step in addressing it, and this requires us to question what we often take for granted as "normal" or "neutral." When we think about library collections, we generally consider them as repositories of knowledge. But what if that knowledge has been shaped by and reflects a history of colonial power dynamics? </p>
<p>
In assessing our library collections, here are some key indicators that colonial bias may be present:</p>
<p><ul>
<li>Lack of Representation: How many works by Indigenous, Black, or other marginalized authors do you have? Is there a fair balance between Western and non-Western knowledge? The absence of diverse voices, perspectives, and experiences is often a direct result of colonial imbalances in what is considered "valuable" knowledge.</li>
<li>Eurocentric Narratives: Do our collections prioritize European or Western worldviews, presenting them as the default or universal truth? Non-Western perspectives are often presented as "other," relegated to special sections or marked as exceptions. This reinforces the idea that European or Western thought is the center of all intellectual inquiry.</lI>
<li>Misrepresentation and Stereotyping: When non-Western authors or subjects are included, are they reduced to simplistic or stereotypical representations that fail to reflect the complexity of their cultures and histories? This form of misrepresentation perpetuates damaging colonial narratives, casting non-Western people and cultures as inferior or lesser.</li>
<li>Colonial Language and Terminology: Language plays a powerful role in shaping how we understand the world. Colonial terms like "primitive," "savage," or "uncivilized" still linger in many cataloging systems and book descriptions, reflecting outdated and harmful worldviews that devalue non-Western knowledge systems. Are these terms still part of our libraries' lexicon?</li>
<li>Silencing Indigenous and Local Knowledge: One of the most enduring effects of colonialism in libraries is the erasure or marginalization of Indigenous knowledge systems. These systems of knowing, often oral or experiential, are systematically excluded from academic institutions, which have historically privileged written, Western forms of knowledge. How many resources in our libraries give space to Indigenous knowledge on equal terms with Western scholarship?</li>
</ul></p>
<p>
Edward Said, in his seminal work Orientalism (1978), showed how the Western academic world constructed an image of the "Orient" as the exotic, backward "Other," framing it as a place needing control and civilizing. This framework of categorization continues to influence how knowledge is organized today. Libraries, as "gatekeepers" of knowledge, have been complicit in perpetuating these colonial constructs by organizing, storing, and disseminating information in ways that reflect these biased narratives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>
Steps to Assess Colonial Bias in Our Collections</b></p>
<p>
Once we've recognized the signs of colonial bias, we can begin to take concrete steps to assess and address these biases in our own collections. This process requires careful evaluation of the materials we hold, the ways they are categorized, and how they are made accessible to library users. Here are some steps to start with:</p>
<p><ul>
<li>Review Collection Development Policies: Do our policies explicitly reflect a commitment to inclusivity and decolonization? A strong decolonial approach should prioritize materials that challenge traditional knowledge systems, amplify marginalized voices, and bring diverse perspectives into the mainstream.</li>
<li>Audit our Collections for Diversity: A collection audit is a critical tool in identifying gaps in representation. How much representation do non-Western, Indigenous, and marginalized voices receive in our collections? Consider this audit not just in specialized areas like Indigenous Studies or Post-Colonial Studies, but across all subject areas, including the arts, sciences, and history.</lI>
<li>Engage with Community Stakeholders: True inclusivity cannot be achieved without listening to those whose voices have been silenced. Engaging with Indigenous communities and other marginalized groups represented in our collections will help us understand whether our materials serve their needs and if they accurately represent their knowledge systems.</li>
<li>Challenge our Classification Systems: How are materials categorized in our libraries? Do classification systems like Dewey Decimal or Library of Congress reflect a Eurocentric worldview? Reassess our classification schemes and consider incorporating systems that reflect Indigenous, local, or non-Western knowledge.</li>
<li>Make Room for Indigenous and other marginalized Knowledge: Decolonizing our collections also means actively seeking out Indigenous knowledge sources. This may include oral traditions, indigenous research methodologies, and local historical narratives that are often overlooked in mainstream scholarship.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>
Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak's work on the subaltern (1988) provides a vital perspective for understanding the way colonialism silenced the voices of marginalized people. Spivak explores how intellectual and cultural systems have rendered the voices of Indigenous peoples and other colonized groups invisible, leaving their knowledge untold and unheard. Libraries can play a key role in rectifying this by amplifying the voices of those once silenced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>
Why This Matters: The Path to Healing and Repair</b></p>
<p>
Libraries are more than just repositories of knowledge; they are powerful cultural institutions that shape how societies view and value knowledge itself. By confronting colonial bias in our collections, we not only correct historical wrongs but also engage in an act of social repair. This work is an essential part of decolonization — a process that extends far beyond libraries and involves rethinking how power is distributed in the creation, validation, and dissemination of knowledge.</p>
<p>
This process requires patience, dedication, and a willingness to engage in uncomfortable self-reflection. But it also opens up the potential for transformative change in how libraries serve their communities, allowing marginalized voices to be heard and valued on equal footing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>
Conclusion</b></p>
<p>
The question of whether our collections are part of the problem may be uncomfortable, but it is a question that libraries must confront head-on if we are to live up to our mission of serving all people. By auditing and revising our collections, we take a crucial step toward creating libraries that are inclusive, equitable, and just. This process is not just about shifting the contents of our shelves but about transforming the very foundation of our knowledge systems — creating a more just and representative future for all.</p>
<p>
Libraries have the power to heal, to educate, and to disrupt the status quo. The work of decolonizing our collections is one important step in creating libraries that serve as equitable spaces where knowledge from all corners of the world is valued equally.</p>

I know that they can burn books, raze libraries, ban languages, banish beliefs, erase pasts, erase presents, order futures, torture and execute people. But I also know that they have not yet discovered how to kill the intangible and luminous body of an idea, a dream, or a hope (E. Civallero.
