This post is part of a series that reviews decolonialism in libraries, archives and other similar spaces, from the perspective of the Global South and the margins, and how colonialism affects collections, staffing, services, activities, policies, and results. Check all the posts in this section's <a href="../blog.html" title="Blog">index</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>
Introduction</b></p>
<p>
Acquisition policies are at the heart of library collections. They determine what knowledge is considered worthy of preservation and dissemination, and they can shape the cultural and intellectual landscape for generations.</p>
<p>
However, these policies have often been designed within narrow frameworks, historically reinforcing colonial and Eurocentric power structures. By reevaluating and challenging these frameworks, libraries have the potential to become revolutionary spaces where diverse narratives, particularly those of marginalized communities, are given the attention and respect they deserve. Designing inclusive acquisition policies is not only a matter of ethics but also a critical step in dismantling centuries of colonial legacy in libraries and archives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>
The Power of Acquisition Policies</b></p>
<p>
Acquisition policies are the silent architects of library collections. While often treated as administrative tools, these policies reflect deeply embedded societal values. What materials are chosen for inclusion and what are excluded? Which authors are celebrated, and which are ignored? These decisions influence not just the content of collections but the very framework of knowledge that libraries offer their communities.</p>
<p>
Historically, acquisition policies have largely prioritized works that align with Eurocentric, Western values and traditions, marginalizing other ways of knowing. Colonialism has played a significant role in this process, with colonial powers systematically collecting, controlling, and often misrepresenting knowledge produced by Indigenous, Black, and non-Western communities. Even today, libraries continue to follow frameworks that have been shaped by this colonial history, inadvertently perpetuating these power imbalances.</p>
<p>
The books we don't have tell us just as much about who we are as the books we do have. What libraries choose to collect, and what they don't, says a lot about their institutional priorities and their stance on whose knowledge is valuable.</p>
<p>
By actively changing the structures of acquisition, libraries can offer a fuller, more inclusive picture of the world, honoring the intellectual contributions of marginalized communities while dismantling the colonial framework that has shaped so much of our intellectual heritage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>
Breaking Away from Colonial Frameworks</b></p>
<p>
For much of history, libraries and archives have been governed by Western epistemological frameworks, which have often served to silence or misrepresent non-Western forms of knowledge. These frameworks were influenced by colonial powers that defined what was considered "valuable" knowledge and excluded alternative worldviews. Many acquisition policies still reflect these colonial biases, underrepresenting the rich diversity of human thought and experience.</p>
<p>
Decolonizing acquisition policies requires a radical shift in perspective. It's about questioning longstanding assumptions and making space for materials that have been historically marginalized. It's essential to:</p>
<p><ul>
<li>Actively seek materials that come from underrepresented communities, ensuring that works by Indigenous, Black, and other historically marginalized groups are included.</li>
<li>Challenge the dominance of Western narratives in favor of knowledge that reflects diverse experiences, ideologies, and histories.</li>
<li>Recognize the value of non-traditional formats, including oral histories, visual arts, and community-produced materials, which may not fit into the rigid structures of traditional publishing.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>
In addition to these actions, libraries must consider their role in reinforcing or dismantling colonial structures. This means not just reviewing what is added to collections, but also how materials are acquired, processed, and made accessible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>
The Role of Librarians as Disruptors</b></p>
<p>
Librarians are more than neutral custodians of information: they are stewards of cultural and intellectual heritage. The very act of acquiring materials is a political one. Librarians must challenge conventional approaches to collection development and take an active role in decolonizing acquisition practices. This means pushing back against institutional biases, examining their own assumptions, and working towards the inclusion of voices and histories that have been systematically excluded.</p>
<p>
The process of acquiring materials should be seen as an opportunity to disrupt the status quo. Librarians, through their acquisition practices, can help shift societal norms, moving beyond the confines of traditional frameworks to support inclusive, equitable, and representative collections. This requires an intentional effort to:</p>
<p><ul>
<li>Collaborate with diverse communities, both locally and globally, to ensure that the materials they produce are recognized and included.</li>
<li>Rethink what constitutes "quality" knowledge, and acknowledge that excellence does not always align with traditional publishing or Eurocentric standards.</li>
<li>Foster partnerships with community groups, scholars, and activists who represent marginalized perspectives, ensuring that their knowledge is preserved and shared in libraries.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>
The work of challenging acquisition policies is ongoing. It requires sustained commitment, education, and the willingness to confront uncomfortable truths about library practices and their role in perpetuating systemic inequalities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>
The Impact of Inclusive Acquisition</b></p>
<p>
By designing inclusive acquisition policies, libraries have the potential to create more diverse, inclusive, and representative collections. These policies can result in:</p>
<p><ul>
<li>Empowerment of Marginalized Communities: Ensuring that the works of underrepresented groups are included in library collections not only validates their contributions but empowers those communities. For instance, the inclusion of Indigenous literature, history, and knowledge helps reclaim and strengthen cultural identities that have been systematically oppressed.</li>
<li>A More Holistic Understanding of the World: Collections that reflect a range of perspectives offer users a more nuanced, multifaceted understanding of history, culture, and society. By incorporating diverse viewpoints, libraries create opportunities for dialogue and engagement that challenge dominant narratives and encourage critical thinking.</li>
<li>Creation of Dynamic Learning Spaces: Inclusive acquisition policies help create library spaces where learning is dynamic, relevant, and reflective of the world we live in. These libraries can serve as hubs for social change, challenging users to reconsider inherited ideas and actively engage with knowledge that has historically been marginalized.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>
Conclusion</b></p>
<p>
The design and implementation of inclusive acquisition policies are crucial for libraries that aspire to be agents of social change. By breaking traditional acquisition frameworks, libraries can create collections that reflect the diverse, multifaceted world we live in. This process requires librarians to act as disruptors — challenging established norms and pushing for the inclusion of marginalized voices. </p>
<p>
Only by embracing these changes can libraries move toward becoming truly inclusive spaces, where knowledge is liberated from the constraints of colonial power dynamics and where all users are invited to engage with the fullness of human thought and culture.</p>
