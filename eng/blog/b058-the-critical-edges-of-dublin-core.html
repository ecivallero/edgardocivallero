<p class="notainicial">
This post is part of a series that explores how metadata can be used as a site of resistance, refusal, and poetic subversion. From classification to linked data, the series investigates how cataloging practices can encode oppression, and how they can be reimagined to challenge dominant systems and speak from the margins. Check all the posts in this section's <a href="../blog.html#metarevolt" title="Blog">index</a>.</p>

<h3>
Dublin Core as the Everyday Schema</h3>
<p>
Since its creation in 1995, the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set has been the most widely adopted descriptive standard in the digital information field. With just fifteen elements, it was designed to be "simple and generic," a lowest-common-denominator schema that could be used by libraries, archives, museums, and websites alike. Precisely because of that simplicity, it has often been dismissed as trivial: a minimal checklist rather than a meaningful descriptive system.</p>
<p>
And yet, ubiquity is never neutral. Dublin Core is embedded in repositories, cultural heritage platforms, personal websites, and grassroots archives across the globe. For many practitioners, it is the first and sometimes only encounter with metadata standards. Its very flatness shapes practice at scale: it sets expectations for what counts as "enough" description, and in doing so it quietly encodes assumptions about knowledge, authorship, and legibility.</p>
<p>
Unlike RDF, which enforces a rigid triple syntax, or SKOS, which normalizes vocabularies into hierarchies of labels, Dublin Core operates with vagueness. This vagueness is often criticized as imprecision. But that imprecision can be turned outward. It can be exploited as space for alternative logics, refusals, and contextual inscriptions that exceed the schema's original intent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>
Neutrality as a Mask</h3>
<p>
On the surface, elements such as dc:title, dc:creator, dc:description, or dc:coverage seem innocuous. </p>
<p>
But as critical metadata scholarship has shown, no descriptive category is ever purely technical. To ask for a "title" presumes that objects can and should be given fixed names. To record a "language" through ISO 639 codes assumes that only standardized, written languages are valid. To define "coverage" in terms of geography and chronology privileges Western spatiotemporal logics over seasonal or relational ones.</p>
<p>
What makes Dublin Core distinct from more complex ontologies is not the absence of ideology, but the openness of its fields. Because the schema is underspecified, it tolerates ambiguity. Unlike RDF, it does not demand conformance to a strict grammar. This tolerance creates a double bind: it allows flattening when applied uncritically, but it also permits subversion when applied strategically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>
Tactical Appropriation in Practice</h3>
<p>
Consider the description of a ritual song within a community archive. In a conventional Dublin Core record, the title would be stabilized, the language reduced to a three-letter code, and the coverage expressed as a date and location. But a different approach is possible. dc:title can be recorded as "Name withheld by request." dc:language can state "Quechua, oral variant not ISO-coded." dc:coverage can be expressed as "time of maize flowering." dc:description can note that transcription is intentionally absent, and that the recording is restricted.</p>
<p>
Or take the case of a woven object cataloged in a repository as "basket." Within Dublin Core, description can capture the fact that community members contest this label, that its use is restricted, or that its significance lies in seasonal cycles rather than material form. Creator can be expanded to record collaborative or ancestral presence rather than an isolated individual.</p>
<p>
These are not violations of the standard. They are deliberate uses of its vagueness to encode situated knowledge, refusal, and relationality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>
Minimal Standards, Maximal Openings</h3>
<p>
Standards discourse has often treated Dublin Core as insufficient, especially when compared to richer frameworks such as RDF, MODS, or schema.org. But insufficiency itself can be an opening. Where RDF insists on clarity, Dublin Core permits ambiguity. Where SKOS requires terms to be hierarchically reconciled, Dublin Core accepts loosely defined entries. This "weakness" can be mobilized as strength.</p>
<p>
In practical terms, Dublin Core is often the only schema applied to community archives, grassroots projects, or small-scale repositories. This means that tactics of appropriation at the Dublin Core level matter. They shape how knowledge circulates far more widely than RDF graphs or ontology design. By treating its fields not as neutral containers but as flexible inscriptions, practitioners can introduce contestation, contextuality, and refusal directly into the descriptive layer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>
Toward a Critical Dublin Core</h3>
<p>
This does not mean that Dublin Core was designed for plurality, or that it is free of harm. It was not, and it is not. But its minimalism makes it permeable. It can be bent without breaking. Critical engagement with Dublin Core means understanding that its underspecification is not a weakness to be corrected but a condition that can be appropriated. Rather than treating it as a shallow standard, we can use it as a platform for situated description, encoding difference where dominant systems expect uniformity.</p>
<p>
Dublin Core's global presence has made it appear harmless, but harmlessness is precisely the illusion that sustains its authority. Every time we fill a Dublin Core field, we reproduce its assumptions — or we resist them. The schema's minimalism is not empty; it is a space of contestation. To describe with Dublin Core is to decide what counts as visible, what remains unsaid, and whose knowledge circulates. The challenge is to stop treating it as a neutral checklist, and to start recognizing it as a terrain where even the smallest interventions can be subversive.</p>
