This post is part of a series that reviews decolonialism in libraries, archives and other similar spaces, from the perspective of the Global South and the margins, and how colonialism affects collections, staffing, services, activities, policies, and results.

<p><b>
Introduction</b></p>
<p>
The legacy of scientific fieldwork in tropical regions is not confined to the specimens collected or the papers published. It extends into the very archives that house these materials, where knowledge is shaped, framed, and often distorted by the politics of its collection. For archivists, librarians, and memory workers, the question of how to document and organize colonial scientific materials requires a reckoning with the power structures that shaped their creation and dissemination.</p>
<p>
When we look at scientific expeditions in the tropics, we must ask: How were the voices of the people who facilitated those expeditions —and whose knowledge made them possible— omitted from the record? How do we address the fact that the archive itself, in its very formation, reinforced colonial structures of power?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>
Cataloguing Through a Colonial Lens</b></p>
<p>
The first step in addressing the colonial roots of scientific fieldwork is understanding the archives themselves.</p>
<p>
Many of the specimens, journals, and field notes housed in scientific institutions around the world were collected under colonial conditions. Yet, when these materials were catalogued, they were organized under frameworks that often excluded the contributions of Indigenous knowledge keepers, local guides, and other collaborators.</p>
<p>
The classification systems used in these archives —whether biological taxonomy, geographic descriptors, or anthropological categories— were shaped by colonial agendas. The names that appeared in these records were rarely those of the Indigenous people who guided the expeditions or identified the specimens; instead, it was the names of European explorers, scientists, and institutions that were preserved. Scientific documentation became, in essence, a tool for further colonization, reinforcing the notion that knowledge could only be valid if it conformed to Western epistemologies.</p>
<p>
For librarians and archivists working with these collections today, the question becomes: How do we catalog knowledge that has been extracted, misclassified, or erased? How do we reconcile the data within the archives with the ethical imperative to make these materials accessible, accountable, and restorative?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>
The Ethics of Authorship and Attribution</b></p>
<p>
One of the primary challenges in decolonizing scientific archives is the issue of authorship. Scientific records, from field journals to specimen lists, often cite the names of European scientists, but rarely acknowledge the local contributors who made the fieldwork possible. The role of local guides, interpreters, and knowledge keepers is often relegated to the margins, if mentioned at all.</p>
<p>
As librarians, we have a responsibility not only to maintain these records but also to question their integrity. Authorship in scientific archives should reflect the collaborative nature of knowledge production. This includes adding attribution for local contributors and knowledge keepers, when possible, and providing metadata that recognizes their intellectual labor. Further, it requires questioning existing cataloguing systems that prioritize Western methodologies and frameworks, and instead seeking to incorporate Indigenous and local knowledge systems and epistemologies.</p>
<p>
Ethical cataloguing means expanding the scope of authorship beyond the traditional "lead researcher" and recognizing the collective labor that underpins scientific discovery. This may involve creating alternative indexing systems, linking scientific collections with oral histories, and working with local communities to ensure that knowledge is represented and credited appropriately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>
Reframing the Archive: Linking Knowledge Systems</b></p>
<p>
A critical part of the work of decolonizing archives is recognizing the limitations of traditional classification systems. Western systems of cataloguing and classification —whether in libraries, archives, or museums— are based on epistemologies that often exclude non-Western ways of knowing. Indigenous knowledge systems, for instance, are often oral, experiential, and relational, rather than text-based and fixed in time.</p>
<p>
In the context of tropical scientific fieldwork, this presents a unique challenge. Specimens may be classified according to Western taxonomies, but the knowledge embedded in these specimens —knowledge about their cultural significance, ecological roles, and traditional uses— often remains invisible. This gap in classification not only distorts the historical record but also perpetuates the erasure of Indigenous epistemologies.</p>
<p>
To address this, archivists and librarians must embrace a more flexible approach to classification. This could include incorporating Indigenous and local names, meanings, and uses into the metadata of scientific specimens. It could involve cross-referencing botanical or zoological specimens with Indigenous and local knowledge systems and oral histories. Such practices not only enrich the record but also provide a more accurate, holistic representation of the knowledge that has been transmitted through generations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>
Practical Steps for Decolonizing Archives</b></p>
<p>
Decolonizing scientific archives is not just about adding new metadata or acknowledging omissions; it is about rethinking the entire process of knowledge production, documentation, and access. To truly restore the record, archivists and librarians must engage with the communities from which the knowledge originated, ensuring that their voices are not only heard but integrated into the ongoing documentation process.</p>
<p>
Decolonizing scientific archives requires addressing several key issues, starting with the need for consultation with local communities. By collaborating with Indigenous and local knowledge holders, we can ensure that their contributions are properly recognized and integrated into the archive. This collaborative process helps build a more complete record that reflects the diverse voices that shaped the knowledge we now hold.</p>
<p>
Another important aspect is the reassessment of existing cataloguing systems. These systems, which have traditionally been built on Western epistemologies, often fail to represent the full spectrum of knowledge present in the scientific record. To decolonize the archive, these systems must be critically reviewed and adjusted to be more inclusive of diverse epistemologies, particularly Indigenous and local systems of knowledge that were historically marginalized or erased.</p>
<p>
The process of creating collaborative archives is also crucial in moving towards a decolonized space. Archives should reflect the collaborative nature of knowledge production, where the contributions of local knowledge keepers are given equal value alongside those of the "official" scientists. This means not only acknowledging the roles of local guides and informants but also ensuring their voices are preserved in the records.</p>
<p>
Lastly, we must address the issue of provenance and metadata. Scientific collections often carry a colonial legacy in their documentation, and it's vital to ensure that the provenance of these materials is fully documented. Metadata should reflect the colonial context in which these collections were made, acknowledging the power dynamics that shaped the creation and use of the materials. By doing so, we begin to correct the historical narrative and make the archive a more accurate reflection of the past.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>
Moving Toward a More Inclusive Archive</b></p>
<p>
The work of decolonizing scientific archives requires more than just a superficial change in how materials are catalogued or presented. It demands a fundamental shift in how we understand knowledge itself. The collaborative and often contested nature of knowledge production must be recognized for us to be able to create more inclusive archives — archives that respect all contributors and acknowledge the power dynamics that shaped the records we hold today.</p>
<p>
As librarians, archivists, and memory workers, we have the unique opportunity —and the ethical responsibility— to transform how knowledge is documented, stored, and shared. We can contribute to the creation of an archive that is not just a reflection of history, but a space for restitution, repair, and justice.</p>
