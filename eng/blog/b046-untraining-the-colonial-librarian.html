<h3>
Introduction</h3>
<p>
Librarianship is often seen as a neutral and objective profession. However, it's actually a tool of power and potential transformation. </p>
<p>
Libraries are custodians of knowledge, and as such, they have a responsibility to interrogate the sources of that knowledge. Since colonial legacies continue to shape access to information, training library staff in decolonial practices is not just a necessity but an urgent act of resistance. </p>
<p>
This post explores how librarians, as key players in the fight for equitable access to information, can be trained to challenge the colonial structures that permeate library work, and promote practices that empower marginalized communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>
Understanding the Colonial Legacy in Libraries</h3>
<p>
Colonialism has shaped libraries and information systems for centuries, influencing everything from the way knowledge is categorized and disseminated to the types of materials that are valued and preserved. Libraries were historically aligned with colonial power structures, often serving as instruments of control and cultural domination. The very way libraries organize knowledge —through classification systems like the Dewey Decimal System, which reflects Western cultural biases— remains a reflection of a Eurocentric worldview. These systems impose particular ways of seeing the world while marginalizing others.</p>
<p>
To address these embedded biases, it is crucial that libraries engage in critical self-reflection. It is essential to examine library practices that might unconsciously perpetuate colonial structures, such as prioritizing Western sources and narratives while overlooking indigenous knowledge systems and non-Western perspectives. Training staff in decolonial practices involves more than simply diversifying collections or offering programs on cultural sensitivity — it requires a deep transformation in how libraries think about knowledge, authority, and the relationship between libraries and the communities they serve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>
Decolonial Training: Moving Beyond Tokenism</h3>
<p>
Decolonial training for library staff cannot be limited to a one-off workshop or an occasional training session. It must be an ongoing, critical practice that challenges the assumptions and biases librarians hold, both individually and institutionally. Decolonial thought requires a complete overhaul of how knowledge is perceived and valued. In the context of libraries, this means moving beyond tokenistic diversity initiatives and towards a fundamental reshaping of how libraries engage with and represent knowledge.</p>
<p>
Many libraries have made efforts to add more diverse books to their collections, but these actions are often superficial if they do not address the underlying systems of power that shape how books and information are created, valued, and accessed. Librarians must be trained to understand and critique the power dynamics that shape knowledge production and dissemination, and be equipped to challenge them. This involves moving from merely collecting diverse materials to actively interrogating whose voices are heard and whose are silenced in the library's collections, programs, and services.</p>
<p>
Training must also include a focus on understanding and addressing the historical erasure of marginalized communities. Decolonial librarianship involves not only the addition of materials from these communities but also ensuring that their histories, languages, and ways of knowing are respected and celebrated. Librarians need to be trained to see themselves as active agents in this process — workers not just in a system of knowledge but in the ongoing process of knowledge-making itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>
Key Elements of Decolonial Training for Librarians</h3>
<p>
To equip librarians with the tools to engage in decolonial practices, training programs should include several core components:</p>
<p><ul>
<li>Critical Awareness of Colonial Structures: Staff must be educated about the history and ongoing effects of colonialism in libraries and beyond. This means understanding how colonial power is embedded in library systems, including cataloging, classification, and the archiving of materials. A thorough analysis is necessary of how Western-centered systems of knowledge influence library practices and, by extension, the communities they serve.</li>
<li>Reclaiming Knowledge: Librarians should be trained to value and incorporate indigenous and local knowledge systems into their collections. This means not only collecting materials that represent these traditions but also collaborating with communities to ensure their voices are heard and respected in the library's practices. Collaboration between libraries and indigenous / local groups is important to ensure that knowledge is not only preserved but also integrated into the broader narrative of the community.</li>
<li>Critical Cataloging and Classification: One of the most visible ways that libraries perpetuate colonial structures is through their cataloging and classification systems. Training must encourage librarians to critically examine classification schemes like Dewey Decimal and Library of Congress Subject Headings, and to explore alternative systems that might better represent marginalized communities' experiences. Decolonial librarianship involves the creation of cataloging systems that reflect diverse worldviews, not just Eurocentric paradigms.</li>
<li>Community Engagement and Empowerment: A crucial part of decolonial training involves fostering community engagement. Libraries should not be passive recipients of collections but active partners in the creation and sharing of knowledge. Librarians should be trained to work closely with underrepresented communities to identify their needs and to build collections and programs that reflect those communities' values, interests, and histories. Knowledge must be liberated from colonial structures, and librarians can play an active role in this process by engaging with the communities they serve.</li>
<li>Building Allyship Across Professions: Decolonial librarianship requires collaboration across sectors. Librarians should be trained to work alongside educators, archivists, community leaders, and activists to build holistic, community-centered approaches to decolonization. Forming networks of solidarity is vital to ensure that decolonial efforts in libraries are part of broader movements for social justice and equity.</li>
</ul></p>

<h3>
Challenges to Implementing Decolonial Training</h3>
<p>
While the need for decolonial training is clear, implementing it can be challenging. Libraries are not neutral institutions — they are embedded within social, political, and economic systems that uphold inequality. As a result, decolonial training can meet resistance from staff, administrators, and even library patrons who are uncomfortable with the idea of challenging long-standing practices. In such cases, training must be approached as a process of long-term transformation, not a quick fix.</p>
<p>
There are also practical challenges to consider. Decolonial training requires a significant investment in time and resources, and libraries must be committed to providing ongoing support and training for staff. Library leaders must create spaces for continuous reflection and professional development that go beyond surface-level initiatives. These spaces can serve as platforms for discussing the challenges and successes of decolonial work, allowing librarians to collectively reflect on how they can improve their practice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>
Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Decolonial training for library staff is essential to dismantling the colonial structures that still permeate library practices today. By developing a deeper understanding of the colonial legacy, reclaiming indigenous knowledge, and challenging Western-centered classification systems, librarians can become powerful agents of change. Libraries can either reinforce colonial power or serve as sites of resistance and empowerment. The key to transforming libraries into spaces of justice and equity lies in the training and ongoing support of library staff to challenge the status quo and embrace decolonial practices.</p>
<p>
Decolonial librarianship is a revolutionary act, one that asks librarians to confront their own biases and assumptions and to engage in the work of healing and reconciliation with the communities they serve. In doing so, librarians can truly become revolutionaries — part of a vanguard movement that seeks to undo the legacy of colonialism and create libraries that are inclusive, equitable, and transformative for all.</p>
