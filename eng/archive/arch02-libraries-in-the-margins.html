This section brings together texts that explore librarianship from positions of structural marginality — geographic, social, economic, and epistemic. The margins are not treated here as spaces of deficiency, but as territories where alternative forms of knowledge, cultural practice, and institutional imagination take shape. Rural communities, peripheral neighborhoods, highland ecosystems, grassroots movements, and forgotten territories are approached not as passive recipients of services, but as active producers of memory, language, and meaning. These works examine libraries that operate outside dominant circuits of funding, policy design, professional visibility, and academic recognition. They analyze marginal spaces as laboratories of adaptation, solidarity, militancy, and critique. In these environments, librarianship becomes inseparable from social struggle, territorial belonging, linguistic continuity, and ethical positioning. The margin functions not only as a place, but as a method: a site from which official narratives are annotated, contested, and reinterpreted.</p>

<summary>(+) Abstract</summary>
<p>
<i>Notas desde el páramo</i> develops a situated reflection on territory, rurality, and knowledge from the vantage point of lived experience in the Colombian Andean páramo. Combining autobiographical narrative, cultural observation, and critical librarianship, it interrogates the category of "rural" as an imposed label that positions non-urban territories as peripheral, backward, romanticized, or exotic. Rather than accepting this binary opposition between urban center and rural margin, the text proposes an alternative reading of territorial spaces as epistemic margins: sites where memory, language, and identity persist beyond hegemonic narratives.</p>
<p>
Through descriptive engagement with highland ecosystems, local agricultural practices, migratory histories, and Indigenous linguistic survivals — including toponyms and vernacular terms of Muisca origin — the text foregrounds the intimate relationship between territory, naming, and knowledge. The act of naming plants, birds, climatic patterns, and landscape features is presented as a form of epistemic continuity and cultural resistance. Language functions as both archive and living practice, sustaining territorial memory in contexts historically ignored, marginalized, or ridiculed by dominant urban imaginaries.</p>
<p>
Interwoven with this territorial reflection is a sustained critique of extractive and romanticized approaches to rurality. The text examines internal migrations, neo-rural movements, and development discourses that instrumentalize "nature" or treat rural territories as blank spaces for reinvention. Against these frameworks, it highlights the accumulated ecological knowledge of campesino and Indigenous communities, emphasizing the labor, precarity, and embodied expertise required to sustain life in harsh environmental conditions. Rural knowledge is framed not as nostalgic heritage but as dynamic, adaptive, and historically resilient practice.</p>
<p>
From the standpoint of librarianship and knowledge management, the text extends the metaphor of the margin to information work. Margins are described as the spaces where official narratives are annotated, contested, and reinterpreted. Just as glosses emerge in the blank spaces surrounding printed text, alternative histories and counter-hegemonic interpretations flourish in peripheral territories. The margin becomes a conceptual site of commentary, dissent, and epistemic plurality. In this sense, the text links territorial marginality to broader debates in critical librarianship, memory studies, and Southern epistemologies, suggesting that cultural institutions must attend to these peripheral knowledges rather than reproduce centralizing frameworks.</p>
<p>
The text ultimately proposes attentive listening as an ethical and methodological stance: listening to landscape, to local speech, to ecological rhythms, and to the lived experiences of those who inhabit marginal territories. Knowledge is framed as relational, embodied, and place-based. By situating librarianship within a broader ecology of territory, language, and memory, the text contributes to discussions on decolonial perspectives, rural knowledge systems, environmental memory, and the political dimensions of naming, archiving, and cultural recognition.</p>

<summary>(+) Abstract</summary>
<p>
<i>Bibliotecas en los bordes</i> examines the phenomenon of "libraries at the edges" as one of the richest yet least studied bodies of contemporary librarianship. It focuses on library initiatives operating in marginal, peripheral, or structurally neglected contexts — rural territories, urban belts of poverty, forest regions, mountainous villages, social movements, student collectives, and alternative political projects — that function neither fully inside nor entirely outside dominant institutional systems. Rather than treating these units as anecdotal curiosities, the text positions them as laboratories of adaptive practice, critical thought, and situated professional ethics.</p>
<p>
Drawing primarily on Latin American experiences, the text identifies libraries that have developed in conditions of geographic isolation, economic scarcity, political indifference, or structural exclusion. These institutions often lack formal recognition, stable funding, or institutional support, yet demonstrate high levels of flexibility, community integration, and strategic inventiveness. Through adaptive collection development, localized service design, alliance-building with community actors, and creative resource management, these libraries construct operational models grounded in responsiveness to concrete social realities rather than compliance with hegemonic professional standards.</p>
<p>
The text frames these practices within a broader critique of dominant librarianship, characterized by managerial logics, metrics-driven evaluation, institutional centralization, and standardized policy frameworks. In contrast, libraries at the edges operate from positions of nonconformity, critical dissent, or active resistance. Some are pushed to the margins by geography, ideology, or the populations they serve; others deliberately situate themselves outside mainstream systems to preserve autonomy and align their work with community-defined priorities. In both cases, marginality becomes a productive condition that enables experimentation, solidarity networks, and forms of professional practice grounded in responsibility rather than institutional prestige.</p>
<p>
Central to the argument is the notion of critical librarianship as an embodied, reflexive process. The text emphasizes that operating "at the edges" requires sustained self-examination: dismantling inherited assumptions about professional identity, neutrality, authority, and institutional legitimacy. Critical thinking is presented not as abstract theory but as a practical necessity for survival in adverse environments. Libraries at the edges engage in continuous reconstruction of their own epistemic foundations, discarding imposed models and rebuilding their practices on experiential knowledge, community interaction, and ethical commitment.</p>
<p>
By highlighting examples such as rural school libraries, riverine mobile libraries, reading programs in forest regions, and grassroots cultural initiatives, the text underscores the plurality of possible library roles and the diversity of problems that information institutions may confront. It challenges monocromatic representations of librarianship and expands the professional imaginary to include solidarity-based infrastructures, volunteer labor, precarious sustainability, and small-scale yet socially transformative interventions.</p>
<p>
Ultimately, the text argues that libraries at the edges reveal alternative configurations of librarianship rooted in community accountability, critical consciousness, and social responsibility. They demonstrate that meaningful transformation does not necessarily emerge from institutional centers but from peripheral spaces where information work intersects directly with lived realities. In doing so, the text contributes to broader debates on critical librarianship, community-based information services, epistemic plurality, and the redefinition of professional roles within contexts marked by inequality and structural marginalization.</p>

<summary>(+) Abstract</summary>
<p>
The text articulates a politically and ethically charged reflection on "libraries at the margins," framing marginality not as deficit but as a deliberate and generative position within contemporary librarianship. Margins are conceptualized as spaces situated outside the central circuits of institutional power, policy design, and professional recognition — territories marked by instability, scarcity, and systemic neglect, yet also by autonomy, solidarity, and counter-hegemonic possibility.</p>
<p>
Drawing on long-term engagement with popular, community, rural, Indigenous, and grassroots libraries in Latin America, the text foregrounds marginal libraries as sites of resistance and militancy. These institutions operate in environments characterized by structural inequality, limited state presence, and exclusion from dominant cultural infrastructures. Rather than conforming to standardized professional models, they construct their identities through commitment to social justice, collective memory, inclusion, environmental and territorial struggles, and the defense of local rights.</p>
<p>
Unlike technocratic accounts of library innovation, the text emphasizes the affective, political, and experiential dimensions of marginal practice. Libraries at the margins are described as trenches and barricades: spaces where information work becomes inseparable from activism, dissent, and ethical positioning. Their practices are rarely documented in formal bibliotecological literature or international conferences, yet they sustain everyday forms of cultural participation and knowledge circulation that challenge hegemonic definitions of what a library is and whom it serves.</p>
<p>
The text also interrogates the costs of marginality. Precarity, emotional exhaustion, repeated failure, and material deprivation are presented as structural conditions of this work. However, marginality simultaneously enables experimentation, improvisation, and forms of creativity that would be constrained within institutional centers. In these peripheral spaces, solidarity networks replace bureaucratic hierarchies, and collective bonds become the primary infrastructure sustaining projects over time.</p>
<p>
Central to the argument is the rejection of professional neutrality. Libraries at the margins are depicted as openly positioned actors within social conflicts. They advocate, resist, organize, and accompany communities in struggle. This stance destabilizes the image of librarianship as apolitical service provision and reframes it as socially embedded practice shaped by ethical choices and political commitments.</p>
<p>
By narrating and legitimizing marginal experiences, the text expands the conceptual field of librarianship to include insurgent, community-based, and activist models. It argues that these libraries embody alternative epistemic and institutional logics that unsettle managerial paradigms and re-center librarianship around responsibility, collective agency, and transformative potential. In doing so, the text contributes to critical librarianship, Southern perspectives on knowledge management, and debates on the role of cultural institutions within contexts of inequality and structural marginalization.</p>
