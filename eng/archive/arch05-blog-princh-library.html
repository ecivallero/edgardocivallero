<summary>(+) Abstract</summary>
<p>
<i>Precedents, predecessors</i> argues for the urgent recovery of librarianship's own historical consciousness, positioning the history of documents, libraries, and knowledge transmission as a foundational yet frequently neglected dimension of professional practice. Moving beyond the conventional "history of the book" often confined to introductory courses, it broadens the scope to encompass the full genealogy of documentary formats, materials, technologies, and institutions that have shaped human efforts to encode, preserve, and circulate memory. In doing so, it adopts an expansive understanding of "document" that includes diverse supports and media across cultures and centuries.</p>
<p>
The narrative traces the evolution of writing materials, bindings, inks, printing techniques, and documentary infrastructures, alongside the roles of scribes, printers, binders, booksellers, and collectors. It situates libraries within this continuum as institutions that have alternately guarded knowledge, restricted access, enabled circulation, or suffered censorship, destruction, and memoricide. Far from being uniformly democratic spaces, libraries are presented as historically ambivalent sites marked by elitism, exclusion, and struggle, whose contemporary public character is a relatively recent development.</p>
<p>
By weaving together technological history, cultural production, censorship, and institutional transformation, the text frames the profession's past as an essential resource for critical self-understanding. Recovering this layered history is depicted not as antiquarian curiosity but as a necessary step in strengthening professional identity, ethical awareness, and continuity within contemporary Library and Information Science.</p>

<summary>(+) Abstract</summary>
<p>
<i>Aquatic routes of knowledge</i> traces the historical and contemporary circulation of knowledge along fluvial and maritime routes in Latin America, foregrounding waterways as infrastructures of cultural transmission and library outreach. Beginning with Indigenous canoe peoples of Tierra del Fuego, the Paraná-Paraguay basin, and the Amazon-Orinoco systems, it situates boats as primary vehicles for the movement of oral traditions, stories, and collective memory long before the consolidation of print culture. The arrival of European books introduced new documentary flows that likewise depended on ships and river craft, embedding written culture within existing aquatic networks.</p>
<p>
The discussion then shifts to twentieth- and twenty-first-century mobile library initiatives operating by boat across Peru, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Colombia, Chile, and Argentina. Projects such as bibliobotes, bibliolanchas, and bibliobongos are described as adaptive responses to geographic isolation, dispersed populations, and limited infrastructure. These services combine circulating collections with cultural programming, educational activities, and community engagement, often serving Indigenous and rural communities along river systems and archipelagos.</p>
<p>
By linking ancestral navigation practices with contemporary mobile librarianship, the text frames water routes as enduring corridors of knowledge circulation. Aquatic mobility emerges not as a peripheral innovation but as a structurally coherent model for extending access, sustaining reading cultures, and recognizing the territorial realities of communities whose lifeworlds are shaped by rivers and seas.</p>

<summary>(+) Abstract</summary>
<p>
<i>Containers. And contents</i> reflects on the growing tendency to privilege architectural design over programmatic substance in contemporary library discourse, using rural and community libraries in Guatemala and Colombia as illustrative cases. Framed within the context of Latin American territories marked by infrastructural scarcity and uneven institutional support, the analysis distinguishes between the "container" — the building — and the "contents" — the services, collections, educational programs, and community labor that sustain a library's social function.</p>
<p>
Through the examples of the comunitecas developed within the PAVA project in Tecpán, Guatemala, and the award-winning "Casa del Pueblo" library in Guanacas, Colombia, the text examines how architecturally innovative or visually striking structures can attract media attention, professional recognition, and international acclaim. While acknowledging the value of well-designed, sustainable buildings adapted to local materials and contexts, the discussion interrogates the disproportionate visibility granted to aesthetic and architectural features at the expense of everyday library work.</p>
<p>
The argument situates this imbalance within broader patterns of institutional recognition and cultural consumption, where images of colorful façades circulate widely while the material conditions of librarians, users, and programs remain underexamined. By foregrounding the tension between visibility and function, the text calls for a re-centering of attention on library services, community engagement, educational impact, and structural precarity. The container, however ingenious, cannot substitute for sustained investment in the human and informational infrastructures that give a library meaning.</p>

<summary>(+) Abstract</summary>
<p>
<i>Languages to weave memories</i> examines the role of language as the primary code through which collective memory, intangible heritage, and cultural identity are transmitted, situating endangered Indigenous languages within broader debates on documentation, digital humanities, and open knowledge infrastructures. Framing language as the most pervasive and enduring medium of cultural continuity, the discussion underscores the accelerating global disappearance of linguistic diversity, with particular attention to Latin America, where hundreds of Indigenous languages are currently classified as vulnerable or endangered.</p>
<p>
The analysis emphasizes documentation as a foundational strategy for linguistic recovery, while acknowledging that preservation requires more than archival recording. It must be accompanied by community support, reduction of sociopolitical pressures, and the creation of spaces for active use. The text traces the historical confinement of linguistic documentation to specialized academic circles and contrasts it with the transformative impact of digital technologies, which have expanded access, enabled speaker-led initiatives, and fostered collaborative production of knowledge.</p>
<p>
Examples such as the Curt Nimuendajú Digital Library and the Rising Voices Indigenous Languages initiative illustrate how open repositories, digitized grammars, spoken dictionaries, and networked activism can combine scholarly research, community engagement, and digital tools. Through these cases, the text positions libraries, virtual collections, and participatory platforms as critical infrastructures for safeguarding linguistic heritage and sustaining the plural memories of Abya Yala in a digitally mediated world.</p>

<summary>(+) Abstract</summary>
<p>
<i>Sheltering voices</i> analyzes the preservation of oral knowledge in Latin America through the development of audio libraries and related sound-based documentary initiatives. It begins by situating orality as a foundational medium for transmitting collective memory in Abya Yala, where traditional knowledge has long circulated through spoken narratives, songs, performance, textiles, body art, and other non-written forms. While dominant institutional models have historically privileged written documentation, the text argues that oral transmission remains central even within fully literate societies and cannot be adequately reduced to transcription without significant epistemic loss.</p>
<p>
Within this framework, audio libraries are presented as critical infrastructures for safeguarding linguistic diversity, Indigenous storytelling, community radio productions, and endangered soundscapes. Examples from Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala, and Colombia — including national fonotecas, community-driven recording projects, and multimedia initiatives focused on Indigenous languages — illustrate diverse institutional and grassroots approaches to collecting, digitizing, and disseminating oral heritage. These projects demonstrate how sound archives can function as spaces of cultural resilience, particularly for communities facing discrimination, displacement, and language erosion.</p>
<p>
By foregrounding sound as documentary evidence and as a vehicle of identity, the text calls for libraries and memory institutions to expand their mandates beyond print. The creation of audio libraries and systematic programs for recording oral traditions is framed as an urgent professional responsibility in regions where collective memory continues to travel primarily through voice, and where silence threatens to erase entire knowledge systems.</p>

<summary>(+) Abstract</summary>
<p>
<i>The original voices of central Chaco</i> examines community-driven language revitalization and memory preservation initiatives among Maskoy-speaking peoples of the central Gran Chaco in Paraguay. Situating the Enlhet, Enxet, Enenlhet, and Nenlhet communities within a history marked by war, territorial dispossession, deforestation, and settler expansion, it outlines the dramatic contraction of Indigenous lands and the resulting erosion of linguistic and cultural continuity. The analysis frames language loss not merely as a communicative decline but as the weakening of cosmological knowledge, territorial memory, and intergenerational transmission.</p>
<p>
Central attention is given to the collective Nengvaanemkeskama Nempayvaam Enlhet, whose initiatives combine oral history recording, audiovisual documentation, community radio broadcasting, and multilingual publication. Projects such as Voz Original and Memory of the Ancestral Enlhet Territory mobilize elders' narratives in both written and audiovisual formats, transforming them into accessible digital archives and locally broadcast sound fragments. These practices reinsert Indigenous languages into public space while reconstructing symbolic ties to place and identity.</p>
<p>
By foregrounding participatory documentation, media appropriation, and community-controlled archives, the text situates Indigenous language recovery within broader debates on intangible heritage, digital preservation, and epistemic sovereignty. The "original voices" of central Chaco emerge not as relics of the past but as active instruments for rebuilding collective futures.</p>

<summary>(+) Abstract</summary>
<p>
<i>The southern libraries</i> reflects on the historical trajectory and contemporary condition of libraries in Latin America, conceptualizing them as "Southern libraries" shaped by colonial inheritance, social inequality, and grassroots resistance. It begins by examining the relative invisibility of most libraries within public discourse, contrasting media-celebrated institutions with the vast continental network of modest, under-recognized libraries that operate with limited resources and sustained commitment. These institutions often work in precarious environments, addressing poverty, displacement, violence, and educational deficits through long-term, community-centered engagement rather than short-term measurable "excellence."</p>
<p>
The text situates libraries within a history of transplantation from European models, where access was initially restricted and the written word was aligned with civilizational hierarchies that marginalized Indigenous and rural knowledge systems. This legacy has contributed to persistent mistrust and perceptions of elitism. In response, many public, popular, rural, school, and mobile libraries have developed grassroots practices oriented toward collaboration, cultural activism, and social transformation.</p>
<p>
The notion of "Southern libraries" extends beyond geography to designate institutions that recognize their territorial embeddedness and plural epistemologies. These libraries integrate technological innovation with local traditions, oral knowledge, minority languages, and non-written forms of expression, redefining the concept of "library" as a decolonizing and community-rooted space. Rather than conforming to quantitative evaluation models, they are framed as living infrastructures of memory and knowledge that operate in the multiple "souths" of the global landscape.</p>

<summary>(+) Abstract</summary>
<p>
<i>Two steps behind</i> reflects on the role of libraries within a socio-technical landscape increasingly shaped by market logics, technological acceleration, and the commodification of information. Using an anecdote from Argentine popular music as a conceptual entry point, it advances the argument that libraries should deliberately remain "two steps behind" dominant trends in order to preserve their critical and social functions. Rather than embracing novelty for its own sake, the text advocates for measured adaptation grounded in reflection, continuity, and institutional responsibility.</p>
<p>
Situating libraries within the broader paradigm of the so-called Information Society, the discussion critiques the influence of capitalist consumerism, planned obsolescence, and technological determinism on knowledge management practices. It contends that the pressure to constantly innovate, adopt new services, and compete within market-driven environments risks eroding libraries' traditional missions as stable repositories of collective memory and cultural reference.</p>
<p>
Against the logic of perpetual acceleration, the text proposes a model of librarianship that balances attentiveness to change with historical awareness. Libraries are framed as safe harbors and orientation points in volatile contexts, institutions whose value derives not only from organizing information but from maintaining continuity across temporal shifts. Remaining "two steps behind" becomes a strategy of stewardship, allowing libraries to integrate innovation critically while safeguarding the long-term integrity of knowledge, identity, and communal memory.</p>

<summary>(+) Abstract</summary>
<p>
<i>Where words take shelter</i> reflects on the multiplicity of spaces in which words and knowledge take refuge across Abya Yala, extending the notion of the library beyond institutional walls and written collections. It situates memory primarily within oral transmission, embodied practices, and material culture, emphasizing narrators, artisans, healers, and community elders as custodians of living "collections" preserved through speech, gesture, song, and ritual performance. These personal and communal archives, transmitted from mouth to ear and hand to hand, encode cosmologies, genealogies, territorial knowledge, medicinal practices, and historical experience in forms that resist reduction to print.</p>
<p>
The text broadens the documentary horizon to include objects in which information is embedded: woven textiles, carved masks, painted ceramics, bodily adornments, and ephemeral drawings. Such artifacts function as mnemonic devices and symbolic repositories, preserving fragments of identity and worldview outside conventional book-based systems. Written and digital documents are acknowledged as part of this continuum rather than as its apex, coexisting with codices, audiovisual files, and networked media.</p>
<p>
By rejecting hierarchical distinctions between oral, material, and written forms of knowledge, the text advocates for an inclusive understanding of documentary heritage. Libraries, community houses, cultural centers, and "living books" are presented as complementary shelters for words, each safeguarding tesserae of a broader continental mosaic of memory, language, and cultural continuity.</p>

<summary>(+) Abstract</summary>
<p>
<i>Galapagos' travelling libraries</i> documents the design and initial implementation of a mobile library service in the Galápagos archipelago, a geographically isolated and infrastructurally constrained territory where access to books and information remains limited. Framed within the context of severe geographic dispersion, fragile institutional presence, and the closure of several local libraries, the initiative responds to structural barriers affecting reading practices, educational support, and information circulation across the inhabited islands.</p>
<p>
The project, conceived as a "travelling library," operates through small, curated collections transported by boat between islands and temporarily housed in local schools and community spaces. Its development involved consultation with teachers, park rangers, local authorities, and residents to identify thematic priorities and information needs. In addition to printed materials, the service incorporates locally produced educational resources and digital content distributed through portable storage devices, addressing connectivity limitations and resource scarcity.</p>
<p>
Beyond logistical innovation, the text situates mobile librarianship within broader debates on outreach services, information equity, and cultural infrastructure in peripheral regions. It foregrounds adaptability, community participation, and phased development strategies, envisioning the mobile service as a transitional mechanism capable of stimulating reading engagement and eventually supporting the creation or reactivation of permanent local libraries. The initiative thus exemplifies how library services can operate across dispersed territories, negotiating environmental constraints, institutional fragility, and the social dynamics of small-scale communities while advancing access to knowledge and literacy in remote contexts.</p>

<summary>(+) Abstract</summary>
<p>
<i>Libraries for indigenous communities</i> examines the historical, political, and epistemic challenges involved in designing and delivering library services for Indigenous communities in Latin America. Situated within a continent marked by migration, conquest, racial hierarchies, and cultural suppression, the analysis interrogates the category "indigenous" as both a marker of identity and a site of discrimination, invisibility, and structural exclusion. It argues that although public libraries are theoretically committed to serving all members of their communities, in practice Indigenous populations have frequently been marginalized by institutional models built around written culture, dominant languages, and Eurocentric epistemologies.</p>
<p>
The text traces the library's historical alignment with state power, literacy regimes, and projects of acculturation, highlighting how knowledge institutions have often functioned as instruments of symbolic domination, shaping what counts as culture, memory, and legitimate knowledge. Within this framework, Indigenous peoples have appeared either as absent subjects or as targets of assimilation, rather than as epistemic actors with their own knowledge systems, oral traditions, and modes of transmission.</p>
<p>
Against this background, the discussion foregrounds emerging efforts to rethink library services in culturally responsive and community-based terms. Drawing on experiences from Guatemala and Colombia, it illustrates how locally grounded initiatives — such as community-built libraries and culturally embedded "comunitecas" — can integrate reading promotion, educational support, and collective cultural activities while acknowledging Indigenous languages, worldviews, and territorial ties. These examples underscore the importance of participatory design, intercultural dialogue, respect for traditional knowledge, and the dismantling of stereotypes in professional practice.</p>
<p>
By situating Indigenous library services within broader debates on racism, cultural diversity, epistemic justice, and decolonization in Library and Information Science, the text frames this field as a critical frontier for reconfiguring institutional missions. Serving Indigenous communities is presented not as a specialized add-on, but as a transformative challenge that compels libraries to question their own assumptions about users, documents, knowledge transmission, and cultural authority.</p>

<summary>(+) Abstract</summary>
<p>
<i>Libraries in movement</i> explores the concept and practice of mobile libraries as flexible, adaptive responses to geographic dispersion, infrastructural scarcity, and social exclusion. Rather than treating mobility as an exotic or marginal curiosity within Library and Information Science, the discussion reframes it as a structural strategy for extending access to reading materials and information services beyond fixed institutional walls. Drawing on examples from Africa, Latin America, and Asia — including animal-assisted libraries, boat libraries, bicycle initiatives, and motorized vehicles — the text examines how documents circulate across deserts, rainforests, wetlands, and mountainous territories.</p>
<p>
A central argument challenges the tendency to privilege large, vehicle-based mobile libraries that replicate the appearance and operations of static institutions, while overlooking small-scale, improvised, and community-driven initiatives. Backpacks of books, rotating neighborhood collections, and hand-carried boxes of reading materials are presented as the most frequent yet least documented forms of mobile librarianship. These "micro" services often operate with limited resources but high levels of professional commitment, responding to populations neglected by traditional library infrastructures.</p>
<p>
The text situates mobile libraries within broader debates on outreach services, access equity, cultural mediation, and the circulation of knowledge in peripheral contexts. It underscores the lack of systematic guidelines for alternative, low-cost models and calls for greater recognition of grassroots practices that sustain reading ecosystems in remote and underserved communities. Mobility, in this framework, becomes less a logistical feature than a defining principle of library work: keeping collections alive by ensuring their continuous movement across social and territorial boundaries.</p>

<summary>(+) Abstract</summary>
<p>
<i>The people's libraries</i> examines the tradition and contemporary practice of "popular libraries" in Latin America, focusing on community-created and community-sustained initiatives that operate outside or alongside official public library systems. Drawing on examples from Argentina and Chile, it analyzes libraries founded through grassroots organization, neighborhood mobilization, and cultural activism, often in territories underserved by state infrastructures. While some Argentine popular libraries maintain legal recognition and receive limited institutional support through national frameworks, many others function autonomously, relying on collective labor, local solidarity, and minimal resources.</p>
<p>
The discussion situates these initiatives within broader debates on access, cultural participation, and the social function of libraries. In contexts where national public library networks fail to reach marginalized urban neighborhoods or informal settlements, popular libraries emerge as adaptive responses shaped by specific territorial needs. They frequently combine reading promotion with community gatherings, political education, artistic activities, and social support, redefining the library as a space of encounter and mobilization rather than a passive repository of books.</p>
<p>
By foregrounding libraries literally built and maintained by local residents, the text challenges standardized models of librarianship and institutional conformity. It frames popular libraries as expressions of civic agency and collective self-organization, highlighting their potential as instruments of social transformation and egalitarian cultural access. In doing so, it expands the understanding of public culture infrastructure to include informal, activist, and community-driven forms of knowledge circulation.</p>

<summary>(+) Abstract</summary>
<p>
<i>Those who manage the sounds</i> examines the evolution of libraries from institutions historically centered on the written word toward broader documentary spaces capable of managing sound as a legitimate and essential form of knowledge. Beginning with a reflection on the etymological and institutional association between libraries and books, the discussion challenges the persistent bias that privileges textual formats over other documentary supports. It argues that contemporary libraries increasingly operate as managers of documents in the widest sense, encompassing any medium capable of storing and transmitting information.</p>
<p>
Within this expanded framework, audio libraries emerge as specialized infrastructures dedicated to the preservation, organization, and dissemination of sound materials, including spoken word, music, environmental recordings, and oral histories. The text underscores the centrality of orality in human communication and cultural transmission, particularly in relation to identity, memory, and local histories that often remain absent from written archives. It highlights professional networks, international associations, and digital technologies that have strengthened the field, enabling large-scale digitization, online access, and the recovery of endangered languages.</p>
<p>
Drawing on examples from Mexico and Colombia, the discussion situates audio libraries within broader efforts to safeguard intangible cultural heritage and indigenous knowledge. By foregrounding sound as documentary evidence, the text calls for a continued redefinition of library collections and professional practices, advocating for an inclusive understanding of memory that extends beyond print to embrace the full spectrum of human expression.</p>
