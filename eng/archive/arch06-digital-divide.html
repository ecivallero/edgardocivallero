This section brings together texts that examine the digital divide in Latin America and the role of libraries within unequal information environments. Moving beyond celebratory narratives of connectivity, the works analyze how technological infrastructures intersect with economic disparities, rural realities, and the commercialization of knowledge, emphasizing the persistence of structural exclusion despite the expansion of digital networks. Libraries are approached as mediating institutions situated between technological innovation and social responsibility, tasked with ensuring equitable access to strategic knowledge and with confronting the ethical and practical challenges posed by a stratified Information Society.</p>

<p>
<i>Bibliotecas agrícolas, brecha digital e Internet</i> examines the intersection between agricultural libraries, digital inequality, and the consolidation of the so-called Information Society in Latin America. It argues that while contemporary communication technologies have transformed the circulation and storage of knowledge, they have not altered the material foundations of human survival, which remain tied to land, agriculture, and environmental sustainability. Within this context, agricultural knowledge is framed as strategic information essential to social well-being and rural development.</p>
<p>
The analysis situates agricultural libraries as institutions responsible for organizing, preserving, and disseminating historically accumulated expertise related to food production and land management. In predominantly rural regions, such as much of Latin America, these libraries play a critical role in mediating access to locally relevant and culturally situated knowledge. However, the commercialization and technological enclosure of information, combined with unequal access to digital infrastructures and skills, produce a significant digital divide that separates those able to retrieve and use strategic knowledge from those excluded by economic and technological barriers.</p>
<p>
The text highlights the ethical dilemma faced by information professionals operating within this environment. On the one hand, they must engage with digital networks and emerging technological paradigms; on the other, they bear responsibility for ensuring equitable access to knowledge, particularly for marginalized rural communities. The argument ultimately advocates for proactive, socially committed librarianship capable of leveraging open access mechanisms, professional collaboration, and context-sensitive dissemination strategies to bridge informational inequalities and support sustainable development.</p>

<summary>(+) Abstract</summary>
<p>
<i>La brecha digital y su amenaza en Latinoamérica</i> examines the concept of the digital divide and its implications for Latin America, situating the phenomenon within broader socio-economic inequalities that shape access to information and communication technologies. The analysis distinguishes between material inequalities in connectivity and infrastructure and cognitive or educational inequalities related to informational skills, literacy, and meaningful use. It argues that the digital divide cannot be reduced to technological access alone, but must be understood as a multidimensional problem rooted in structural disparities of income, education, geography, language, age, and gender.</p>
<p>
The text contextualizes global concern over digital exclusion within international policy agendas and development discourse, emphasizing the growing centrality of information as a strategic resource in the so-called knowledge society. In the Latin American context, persistent historical inequalities intersect with uneven technological penetration, particularly affecting rural, indigenous, and marginalized communities. The paper further explores the social consequences of digital exclusion, including restricted mobility, reduced democratic participation, limited economic competitiveness, and the emergence of new forms of informational illiteracy.</p>
<p>
Finally, the work reflects on the role of libraries and information professionals in mitigating the intellectual and educational dimensions of the divide. It proposes that libraries, through context-sensitive services and sustained educational initiatives, can contribute to social inclusion by strengthening informational competencies and facilitating equitable access to knowledge.</p>
