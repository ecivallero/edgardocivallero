"And what's a library for?", "Is being a librarian a profession?", "Do you have to study to become a librarian?", "Why should I go to a library when everything is on the internet?", "And what do you do in the library, besides dusting off books and sitting behind a desk all day?" </p>
<p>
For a quarter of a century, my entire professional life as a librarian, I've been hearing those comments (and worse). </p>
<p>
Yeap. </p>
<p>
For all that time, two and a half decades, I've been trying to explain what we do in my line of work. And for those five lustra, I haven't succeeded, judging by how often these questions are repeated in my surroundings nowadays. </p>
<p>
I started recounting the intricacies of my profession 20 years ago, when I launched "Bitácora de un bibliotecario" (A Librarian's Log), one of the first Spanish-language blogs about libraries (the third, to be more precise). The blog is still active, by the way, despite its many ups and downs, and in it, I keep scribbling down ideas, experiences, reflections, encounters, disagreements, and sometimes, a bit of anger and a tantrum or two. That's life: there are no lights without shadows, and libraries are not immune to all sorts of problems. </p>
<p>
Writing (but also giving courses and lectures, or recording podcasts, or...) was and still is my way of sharing my passion for libraries, archives, museums, and all those corners that I now call "spaces for knowledge and memory management": rural libraries, community archives, houses of wisdom, documentation centers, mobile libraries, indigenous museums, reading rooms... All of them, whatever they are called and wherever they are, are places where a community, whatever it may be, encounters and connects to its knowledge and memories: human in general, and their own in particular. And there arises the magic of identity, history, inspiration, innovation, resistance, struggle, change... </p>
<p>
We are the managers of the human knowledge. We are the weavers of its memories. I know it sounds grandiose, and I do know that many times we don't live up to the expectations, but that's what we are. It´s a challenging task sometimes, an impossible one at others, but always full of magical moments, of windows opening to the past and the future, of secrets unveiled, of latent opportunities, of hidden dramas and buried sorrows that surface in a scrap of paper, in the corner of a slide, in a note in the margin of a book... </p>
<p>
The fact that "information is power" and that we, in our spaces, manage it, gives us an enormous capacity to support and accompany social change, cultural resistance, the discovery of identities, the finding of paths and the construction of future horizons, and the building of new historical narratives and alternative views of our knowledge and our memories. We are that, too. Something that implies an enormous responsibility and a kind of strong commitment to our communities. However small they may be, our corners end up being extremely powerful. And while new information technologies have helped us develop and grow, libraries are not that. The essence, what makes us what we are since we began to be, has remained unchanged. </p>
<p>
We have always been the ones who lay the foundations for the castles in the air. </p>
<p>
Hence, we are much more than shelves, dust, boxes, and the smell of old paper. And I'm going to share it, all of it, in a series of letters that I'll write from my library and that I'll share with you through this channel. In them, and to the extent that my limited literary talent allows, I'll try to show you the backstage of our work, the reasons why we do it, the encounters and disagreements, the wonders and joys, the many paths to tread, and the many already traveled in the five millennia of library history. </p>
<p>
So... don't lose track of me! </p>

I know that they can burn books, raze libraries, ban languages, banish beliefs, erase pasts, erase presents, order futures, torture and execute people. But I also know that they have not yet discovered how to kill the intangible and luminous body of an idea, a dream, or a hope (E. Civallero. Head of the blog <i>Bitácora de un bibliotecario</i> between 2004 and 2014).</p>
