<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Hanging on a wall that they cover entirely, three hundred faces woven in plant fibers watch me with their three hundred pairs of empty eyes. They compose a scenario of hollow, tawny, cream, mahogany, and ashy gazes — with their rough threads creating curves and straight lines, and their ancestral designs based on animal profiles, or mythical beings... </p>
<p>
I've just arrived in Panama City (Panama), and one of my first strolls leads me directly to the Old Town: a gridded and colonial peninsula overlooking a bay that stretches to the Pacific, amidst islands and mangroves, within the "tristes tropiques" that Lévi-Strauss described in his renowned travel diary. </p>
<p>
And in that corner of a small, humid, and intense city, hotter than the fifth pot of hell, I find a magical place — a kind of store-gallery on a narrow street. A street covered by colorful hats, suspended several meters above the ground by ropes that cross from sidewalk to sidewalk. </p>
<p>
There, in that gallery, <i>nemboro</i> are sold. <i>Nemboro</i>: the famous "masks" made by the women of the Embera people of the Panamanian Darien rainforest, out of fibers of the "chunga" palm. </p>
<p>
They say that the Embera people of Colombia also make them, as well as their Wounaan neighbors, inhabitants of the lowlands of the Chocó department. I don't remember hearing about them during my years of residence in Colombian lands. However, here, the artisanal —or should I say "artistic"?— works of the Embera of Panama are widely known for their exquisite design, their many details, and, above all, their meanings. </p>
<p>
<i>Nemboro</i> are not actual masks. They are not merely used to disguise their wearers and conceal their identity. At least, they are not just that. Their original name, which in Embera language translates as "head," provides a hint of their ultimate function. By wearing them on their faces, those who don them not only obscure their features but also assume the nature of the entity the <i>nemboro</i> represents. </p>
<p>
And they quite literally transform into something else. </p>
<p>
Hence, a "mask" of an eagle is not just a disguise: it turns the person wearing it into that bird. And it does so to protect the life of the masked one. Originally, <i>nemboro</i> were used exclusively by the <i>jaibana</i>, the "shamans" of the Embera people, during their healing ceremonies. Armed with their sacred wooden staffs, entranced by hallucinogenic herbs, these "witches" battled against any evil spirits that dared to afflict the bodies and souls of the people in their communities. And during those lengthy ceremonies, they would put one or many <i>nemboro</i> "heads" over their mud-colored faces. Transformed into something or someone else, or into many consecutive things, the <i>jaibana</i> were able to mislead and confuse their adversaries... and continue their fight. </p>
<p>
Once their mission was accomplished, those <i>nemboro</i> used in a healing ritual were burned. Inevitably. No one wished the defeated spirits, in a fit of vengeful anger, to seek and find those false faces that humiliated them. </p>
<p>
Moreover, these items were imbued with a particular energy after the rituals. An energy that nobody desired to harbor in their houses. It's akin to as someone in our Western culture deciding to salvage the flowers used in a wake or burial and displaying them in a vase as a centerpiece. In general, many would agree that those flowers should be discarded because they carry a certain symbolic charge that no one would want in their daily life. </p>
<p>
Interestingly, <i>nemboro</i> are now one of the most coveted artistic products in Panama, alongside the mola appliquéd clothes produced by the women of the Gunadule people from the San Blas archipelago. </p>
<p>
It is in this commercial context that I have my first encounter with the Embera "masks." There, in the Old Town of Panama City, on a January Sunday, taking shelter inside a store to escape a noonday sun that scorches everything in its path. </p>
<p>
It is there that I find myself, almost unintentionally, face to face with three hundred pairs of empty eyes made of palm threads, staring at me, inquisitively. </p>
<p style="text-align:center;">***</p>
<p>
The "masks" are marketed in their original sizes —capable of covering a human face, or much larger— as well as in medium and small versions. Except for a couple of long strips that act as support structures, which can be vegetal or wire, the entire piece is carefully woven with thin, short threads, using various patterns. The material used is a stiff fiber extracted from the youngest leaves of a palm known popularly as chunga, macora, or guérregue (<i>Astrocaryum standleyanum</i>). Spread between Costa Rica and Ecuador, the palm provides raw material for making baskets and other everyday items. And <i>nemboro</i>, of course. </p>
<p>
In general, those who produce these works in the Embera communities of Panama —mostly located in the Comarca Embera-Wounaan in the Darien region, to the east of the country, near the border with Colombia— are women. These artisan-artists have managed to recover and preserve traditional structures, techniques, and patterns, even maintaining the old processes of dyeing fibers with natural colors. However, they have also innovated, integrating the use of vivid aniline tones in their work, as well as unusual cutting, weaving, and braiding patterns, into the "masks" of yesteryear. </p>
<p>
As mentioned earlier, <i>nemboro</i> are no longer quite used in the rituals of the <i>jaibana</i>, who can be both men and women. For some time now, these individuals have been experiencing a certain setback in indigenous societies, where the impact of currents like evangelism has been severe. </p>
<p>
Therefore, since they are not used much in healing ceremonies, the "masks" can be sold without any inconvenience. There are no rules or taboos prohibiting such trade, and, most importantly, the "heads" will not be pursued by any spiritual entity seeking revenge. In fact, confronted with their dry gazes, their beaks and open mouths, their sharp or curved silhouettes, there, in the store in Panama's Old Town, I don't sense them laden with "bad energy." Not at all. </p>
<p>
But they do carry meanings, knowledge, and memories, though. That, I can feel. </p>
<p>
I feel an entire universe hanging on that wall in front of me. It's the worldview of a people and the knowledge of generations of artisans and <i>jaibana</i> who collaborated to develop the best way to defeat dark souls. There are crests, fangs, and more and more empty eyes observing me from the depths of time. </p>
<p>
A significant portion of these <i>nemboro</I> could be considered authentic documents, serving as vessels for the transmission of specific types of information. At least, if we adopt the broader concept of "document," common in museums and among the more contemporary currents of information science. </p>
<p>
The "masks" speak of specific materials (fibers, frames, dyes, ornaments), of their strategies of collection and use, and of local ecologies and biologies; of specific construction techniques, with all their many variations across space and time; of the religious meanings of colors and shapes, and the symbolism of iconographies; of stories related to the represented characters, and of others related to the numerous healings (successful and unsuccessful), which are essentially battles against the world of darkness and evil. Ultimately, they represent the culmination of all their components, and a node, or a knot, in the intricate tapestry of Embera traditional knowledge and memory. </p>
<p>
<i>Nemboro</i> tell of territories and people, and their benign and malignant spiritual entities. And they achieve this solely through their silhouettes, volumes, textures, and shades. Incidentally, these features render them aesthetically beautiful, highly appreciated, and valuable objects. </p>
<p>
And, therefore, very marketable. </p>
<p style="text-align:center;">***</p>
<p>
I select one of the smallest among the many "masks" displayed in that store. The larger ones feel too imposing to me. I prefer to have one with me that does not invade my space but keeps me company, allowing me to appreciate its details — the repetitive interweaving of fibers forming a pattern, the color that is stronger here and fades there... </p>
<p>
And one that tells me a story. Its story. </p>
<p>
Its <i>potential</i> story, for example: what would have happened if it had been used by a <i>jaibana</i> in some corner of the ancient Darien forest to combat the nauseating claws of a mythical beast, or the dark influences of a particular shadow? </p>
<p>
But its <i>real</i> story as well. The story of the many women who harvested the chunga leaves, painstakingly extracted the fibers, dyed them, skillfully wove them, and envisioned this or that form, detail, and structure... Or the narrative of those who journeyed kilometers to sell their creations, striving to earn a few coins for survival, or those who were compelled to undersell them due to necessity, or those who fell victims to unscrupulous intermediaries... Stories of resilience and exploitation, of cultural and identity shifts, and also of losses and oblivion. </p>
<p>
I opt for those without bright aniline colors and choose one in dark brown, cream, and beige hues. In the shape of a feline. Is it really one? I'm not entirely certain; it might be a deer. As soon as I have it in my hands, I find myself instinctively classifying it. After all, isn't it a document? Am I not a librarian? </p>
<p>
And, naturally, I realize how unaccustomed my profession is to classify anything other than paper-based documents, and the myriad possibilities that emerge as I contemplate this knowledge-turned-into-a-"mask" that I hold timidly between my fingers. </p>
<p style="text-align:center;">***</p>
<p>
On the empty walls of my new apartment in Panama City, there is enough space to hang several dozen "masks." Hammer and nail in hand, I finish placing the first one: the <i>nemboro</i> that I just bought in the Old Town. I step back a little to look at it from a distance. It's beautiful, with its array of brown tones standing out against the immaculate white background. </p>
<p>
In that moment, I imagine a library shelf with a collection of those indigenous ritual "heads," carefully classified and cataloged, engaging in dialogue with books, articles related to the Embera people, and other documentary materials — understanding "documents" in the broadest sense of the term. And inevitably, questions arise. Why are we taking so long to put into practice this concept of a plural, broad, decolonial, and interdisciplinary "library"? Why do we persist in fragmenting the memory and knowledge of our societies into separate entities as libraries, archives, and museums when, in truth, they form a single, rich, and integral entity? Why does our information universe always revolve around the same formats, media, materials, origins, languages, and codes? Why do we overlook other ways of storytelling, knowledge expression, and memory encoding? </p>
<p>
With these thoughts swirling in my mind, I settle at my desk and begin drafting the first paragraphs of this text. Beside my laptop, carefully spread out, lies a mola: one of the vibrant fabrics crafted by the Gunadule women of Panama and Colombia. An artistic creation with a very different story from the Embera <i>nemboro</i>, yet possessing a similar representational significance. I pause for a moment, lost in the <i>mola</i>'s colors, its drawings, the tiny stitches of the threads that bind the entire work together. And I realize that the same thing I'm about to say about the chunga "masks" could equally apply to the Gunadule fabrics. Perhaps even more so. </p>
<p>
I resolve that this will be a tale for another occasion. And I resume typing this one. </p>

I know that they can burn books, raze libraries, ban languages, banish beliefs, erase pasts, erase presents, order futures, torture and execute people. But I also know that they have not yet discovered how to kill the intangible and luminous body of an idea, a dream, or a hope (E. Civallero. Head of the blog <i>Bitácora de un bibliotecario</i> between 2004 and 2014).</p>
