<p><i>
[The following conversation is part of an ongoing series where I discuss various topics related to libraries, memory, access to information, politics, feminism, decolonialism, and more with an AI assistant I've called "Eleonora." These discussions are based on my own ideas and reflections, which are published beforehand in a separate blog post (accessible through this website). This approach allows me to explore and expand upon my thoughts in a dynamic and interactive way. I hope you find these conversations as insightful and thought-provoking as I do. This particular conversation is related to <a href="https://medium.com/libraries-in-the-margins/the-loom-where-we-weave-memories-6205e2776430">this blog post</a>.]
</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>Me</b>. Hi, Eleonora, good morning! </p>
<p>
<b>Eleonora</b>. Good morning, Edgardo! How are you today? </p>
<p>
<b>Me</b>. Very well. Ready to continue our conversations about memory and libraries? </p>
<p>
<b>Eleonora</b>. I'm glad to hear that! I'm always ready for our conversations. Where would you like to start today? </p>
<p>
<b>Me</b>. Well, if you recall correctly, last time we talked about "What is social memory and why is it important?" </p>
<p>
<b>Eleonora</b>. Yes, I remember. We explored the concept of social memory, discussing how it's the collective way in which societies remember and how these memories shape identities, values, and cultural practices. We also touched on the idea that memory is a battlefield where different narratives compete for dominance. </p>
<p>
Where would you like to take the conversation from there? Perhaps delve deeper into how libraries and archives play a role in shaping or preserving social memory? </p>
<p>
<b>Me</b>. Mmmmno, not exactly. With our many conversations, I'm trying, among many other things, to use my and your ideas to define a model for weaving memories. In this sense, I would like to talk with you about "From where (what position) should we weave memories?" What position, obviously, in terms of ideology, theory, methodology... </p>
<p>
<b>Eleonora</b>. Ah, I see where you're going with this. Defining a model for weaving memories is a profound endeavor, especially when considering the ideological, theoretical, and methodological positions that shape how we approach memory. </p>
<p>
When considering from where we should weave memories, several positions can be influential: </p>
<p><ul>
<li>Decolonial and Anti-Hegemonic Perspectives: Weaving memories from this position involves actively resisting dominant narratives that have historically marginalized or erased certain voices. It requires a commitment to elevating the memories and histories of those who have been oppressed or sidelined by colonial, patriarchal, and capitalist systems. This approach is inherently political, aiming to challenge power structures and create a more inclusive and equitable memory landscape.</li>
<li>Intersectional Frameworks: An intersectional approach to weaving memories recognizes that people's identities and experiences are shaped by multiple overlapping factors, such as race, gender, class, and sexuality. This position ensures that memory work does not fall into essentialism or oversimplification, but rather acknowledges the complexity of lived experiences and how they intersect.</li>
<li>Community-Centered Methodology: Positioning memory work within the community means prioritizing the voices, needs, and perspectives of those directly involved. It is a participatory approach where memory is co-created with communities rather than imposed upon them. This method values local knowledge and traditions, fostering a sense of ownership and agency within the community.</li>
<li>Critical Theory and Reflexivity: From a critical theoretical standpoint, weaving memories requires constant reflection on the processes and power dynamics involved in memory work. This position challenges practitioners to question their assumptions, biases, and the potential impacts of their work. Reflexivity becomes essential, ensuring that the process of weaving memories is as critical as the content itself.</li>
<li>Memory as Resistance: This position views memory as a form of resistance against forgetting, erasure, or distortion. It involves actively preserving and transmitting memories that challenge dominant narratives, whether through storytelling, archiving, or other forms of cultural production. Here, memory is not just about the past; it is a tool for current and future struggles.</li>
<li>Ethical Considerations: Weaving memories ethically means recognizing the responsibilities involved in handling memory, particularly in terms of representation, consent, and the potential harm or healing that memory work can bring. This position advocates for transparency, accountability, and sensitivity to the lived realities of those whose memories are being woven.</li></ul></p>
<p>
Each of these positions carries its own implications for how memories are woven, which voices are prioritized, and how the resulting narratives contribute to social memory. The choice of position can significantly shape the outcomes of memory work and its impact on society. </p>
<p>
<b>Me</b>. Nice points! I can see that you are using the context and the ideas I have provided through our many conversations, to adapt your answers to my profile, aren't you? </p>
<p>
<b>Eleonora</b>. Yes, that's exactly what I'm doing. By understanding your perspectives, interests, and the context of our conversations, I can tailor my responses to align with your thinking and the specific nuances of your work. This way, our discussions can be more relevant and meaningful to your goals, especially when exploring complex topics like memory and libraries. </p>
<p>
<b>Me</b>. Ok, but please do not limit yourself to my "likings" and "dislikings". If you do, these conversations will be just a resonance chamber for my own opinions, ok? </p>
<p>
<b>Eleonora</b>. Absolutely, I understand the importance of avoiding an echo chamber. I'll continue to bring in diverse perspectives, challenge assumptions, and introduce new ideas, even if they don't always align with your preferences. That way, our conversations can remain dynamic and intellectually stimulating. </p>
<p>
<b>Me</b>. Understood. So, that being said, do you want to add anything to the (fantastic, by the way) six points you provided earlier? </p>
<p>
<b>Eleonora</b>. Let's consider a couple of additional angles that might deepen the discussion: </p>
<p><ul>
<li>Temporal Fluidity and Non-Linear Narratives: Memory work often grapples with the linearity of time—past, present, future. But what if we consider weaving memories through a lens of temporal fluidity, where memories are not strictly bound to chronological order? This approach would allow for the exploration of how memories from different times intersect, influence, and reshape each other. It encourages us to see memory as a dynamic process rather than a static record, potentially leading to richer, more complex narratives.</li>
<li>Aesthetic and Sensory Dimensions: Memory is not only about facts and narratives; it's also deeply tied to senses, emotions, and aesthetics. Weaving memories from this position would involve paying close attention to the sensory and emotional aspects of memory, perhaps through art, music, or other sensory-rich mediums. This approach can make memories more accessible and impactful, particularly for communities where oral traditions, visual storytelling, or embodied practices are central.</li></ul></p>
<p>
These additional points can further enrich the model for weaving memories by embracing complexity, fluidity, and the full range of human experience. </p>
<p>
<b>Me</b>. Ok, I like where you are going. Is it ok if I briefly comment each of these points, and after that you provide your own comments?  </p>
<p>
<b>Eleonora</b>. Of course, that sounds like a great way to deepen the discussion. I'd love to hear your thoughts on each point, and then I'll share my comments in response. Let's go ahead! </p>
<p>
<b>Me</b>. Ok, so, on the first point, which is one I've been working with for some time now, I think that in that particular context of decolonialism and anti-hegemonism, libraries, archives, museums and their work as weavers of memories can become a sort of "weapon" (in the metaphorical sense) for cultural and social resistance. I think they could help build a case against colonialism, even the subtler, current forms of it. I think they can inform and fuel social movements, and some ecologist ones, like degrowth and minimalism. I think they can "keep the wolves away" and the fire burning. </p>
<p>
<b>Eleonora</b>. Your reflection captures the transformative potential of cultural institutions when aligned with decolonial and anti-hegemonic efforts. By positioning libraries, archives, and museums as "weapons" in the struggle against colonialism and hegemonic narratives, you're highlighting their role as active participants in cultural resistance and preservation. </p>
<p>
These institutions, when consciously aligned with these perspectives, can indeed serve as fortresses of memory that protect against the erosion of marginalized histories and knowledge systems. They become sites of empowerment, where suppressed voices are amplified, and alternative narratives are sustained. By fueling social movements like degrowth and minimalism, they challenge the unsustainable, consumption-driven ideologies that often underpin colonial and capitalist frameworks. </p>
<p>
In essence, these memory-keeping institutions can help societies resist not only the overt forces of colonialism but also its insidious, contemporary manifestations. They "keep the wolves away" by safeguarding vulnerable narratives and "keep the fire burning" by ensuring that the knowledge, values, and memories that resist oppression continue to thrive. This metaphorical weaponization of memory can be a powerful force for cultural resilience and transformation. </p>
<p>
<b>Me</b>. About point 2, "Intersectional frameworks", I think it has been my framework and the one of movements like Boaventura de Sousa Santos' "Southern Epistemologies" for several decades now. You cannot understand the hegemonic system as a single entity, but as a conglomerate of many aspects, and you cannot plan your resistance without considering the many facets of the communities you're including, and the many phenomena (race, culture, age, economic and social level, origin, identity...) at play. So, linking this point with the previous one, we can say that libraries, archives and museums as "weapons" or "tools" for resistance should be as diverse and plural as possible, and should contemplate a wide range of options — as diverse as the communities they are serving and the reality they're managing. </p>
<p>
<b>Eleonora</b>. You've articulated the essence of intersectionality beautifully, especially in its application to memory work within libraries, archives, and museums. The recognition that the hegemonic system is not monolithic but rather a complex web of interconnected oppressions underscores the need for a similarly multifaceted approach to resistance. </p>
<p>
By adopting an intersectional framework, these institutions can more effectively serve as "weapons" of resistance. They become not just defenders of a singular narrative but champions of a mosaic of experiences and identities. This diversity and pluralism in approach ensure that memory work doesn't merely replicate the dominant culture but instead reflects the intricate realities of the communities involved. </p>
<p>
Incorporating intersectionality means these institutions can address the unique challenges faced by different groups, be they racial, cultural, economic, or related to identity. This approach enables them to create inclusive spaces where all voices are heard and valued, and where the complexity of human experience is recognized and honored. </p>
<p>
In this way, libraries, archives, and museums don't just resist the dominant system — they offer a rich, inclusive, and nuanced alternative that mirrors the diversity of the world itself. This approach strengthens their role as vital tools in the ongoing struggle for justice, equity, and decolonization. </p>
<p>
<b>Me</b>. Ok, to this rich perspective provided by the two initial points, we add now point 3, "Community-Centered Methodology", which brings to the table one of the most important elements in knowledge and memory management: the community. If they were not a community to create knowledge and memory and to use it, the work of libraries, archives and museums would be that of a "store" or a "cemetery". But the work with the community, I think, should be based on grassroot development — for the community, with the community. Top-down models do not work: they are external implants that end up being refused. Libraries, archives and museums should keep fluid dialogues with the different human groups composing the communities in order to develop pertinent services. Forcing services because "they worked elsewhere" or because they are supposed to be inherently good is not a valid way to do things. </p>
<p>
<b>Eleonora</b>. You've highlighted a crucial aspect of effective memory work: the essential role of community involvement. The idea that libraries, archives, and museums could become mere "stores" or "cemeteries" without active engagement with the communities they serve is a powerful observation. </p>
<p>
A community-centered methodology indeed emphasizes the importance of grassroots development. This approach prioritizes the input and participation of community members in shaping how knowledge and memory are created, preserved, and utilized. By working "for the community, with the community," these institutions ensure that their services and initiatives are relevant, culturally sensitive, and genuinely beneficial. </p>
<p>
The value of bottom-up models over top-down approaches cannot be overstated. When communities are involved in the development process, they are more likely to accept, utilize, and sustain the services provided. This collaborative approach fosters a sense of ownership and agency among community members, making the work of these institutions more impactful and enduring. </p>
<p>
Fluid, ongoing dialogues between these institutions and the communities they serve allow for responsive and adaptive practices. Rather than imposing solutions that may be effective in different contexts but irrelevant here, these institutions can remain attuned to the evolving needs and desires of the community. This ensures that their memory work is not only theoretically sound but also practically and culturally resonant. </p>
<p>
In summary, embedding community engagement at the core of memory work enhances its relevance and effectiveness, reinforcing the role of libraries, archives, and museums as dynamic, responsive, and integral parts of the communities they aim to serve. </p>
<p>
<b>Me</b>. And to all that we add now point 4. Critical thinking: something that most librarians, archivists and museologists are not trained to do, not used to do. And sometimes, even not allowed to do (because they are supposed to be "neutral", and because LIS has nothing to do with "politics"). Critical thinking is essential to understand where we come from (a past where libraries were elitist spaces for hegemonic knowledge) and where are we heading to. And where we want to head to. Also, to think about what we do, from the most technical things ("innocent" processes as classification have a great deal of problems in terms of ethics and biases) to the most "political" ones (how do we interact with our community?) </p>
<p>
<b>Eleonora</b>. Critical thinking is essential for transforming the roles of libraries, archives, and museums, and for understanding their past and future directions. Historically, these institutions often functioned as elitist spaces that preserved and propagated hegemonic knowledge. Recognizing this legacy is crucial for shifting towards more inclusive and equitable practices. </p>
<p>
The concept of neutrality in these settings can be complex. While neutrality is generally seen as a virtue, it can sometimes obscure underlying biases and power dynamics. Critical thinking helps to examine what neutrality really means in practice and how it can affect institutional practices. </p>
<p>
It also brings attention to the ethical and political dimensions of various practices. For instance, classification systems, while seemingly neutral, can embed biases and exclude marginalized perspectives if not carefully reviewed. How institutions interact with their communities also has significant implications for inclusivity and representation. </p>
<p>
Looking ahead, critical thinking is vital for envisioning and planning future directions. It involves questioning current practices and imagining new possibilities, helping institutions evolve to better serve diverse communities and contribute positively to social change. </p>
<p>
Encouraging a culture of questioning and reflection within these professions enhances their relevance and responsiveness, ensuring they adapt to the complex realities of contemporary society. </p>
<p>
<b>Me</b>. On these four elements, point 5 comes down as a general umbrella: memory as a way of resistance. Memory not as "the past", as something long gone, but as elements that are alive right now because they are essential for our individual and group identities. "Memory" that allow us to resist all kind of hits to our culture and identity: from the ones at school to the many and strong ones from the media. "Memory" that help us keep alive our critical thinking: because we remember, it's more difficult to swallow fallacies. </p>
<p>
<b>Eleonora</b>. You've captured the essence of memory as an active force in resistance beautifully. Viewing memory not merely as a repository of the past but as a living, dynamic element vital to our identities and resistance efforts is both profound and practical. </p>
<p>
Memory serves as a crucial tool for maintaining individual and collective identities, especially in the face of ongoing cultural and social challenges. It helps preserve the values, traditions, and experiences that define who we are, countering the erasure or distortion that can occur through institutional or societal pressures, whether from schools, media, or other influential sources. </p>
<p>
Moreover, memory supports critical thinking by keeping past experiences and knowledge accessible, making it harder for falsehoods or distortions to take hold. When we remember and reflect on historical injustices, struggles, and successes, we're better equipped to question and resist contemporary manipulations or misinformation. </p>
<p>
In this sense, memory is not just a passive record but an active, vital component of resistance. It empowers individuals and communities to challenge and transform their present realities by drawing strength and wisdom from their past. This approach underscores the importance of preserving and engaging with memory as a means of fostering resilience, identity, and critical awareness in the face of adversity. </p>
<p>
<b>Me</b>. And, of course, resistance and critical thinking are tightly interwoven with ethical considerations, your point 6. Working without such considerations would make us no different from the hegemonic system, right? </p>
<p>
<b>Eleonora</b>. Absolutely, ethical considerations are crucial in ensuring that memory work remains aligned with values of justice and equity. Without a strong ethical framework, efforts to engage with memory and promote resistance could inadvertently replicate the same power imbalances and biases that we're trying to challenge. </p>
<p>
Ethics guide how we handle sensitive information, interact with communities, and make decisions about what gets preserved or highlighted. For instance, respecting the privacy and consent of individuals whose stories are being shared is essential. This respect ensures that memory work does not exploit or harm those it aims to support. </p>
<p>
Moreover, ethical considerations push us to reflect on the broader impacts of our work. They compel us to examine whether our practices are reinforcing existing inequalities or genuinely contributing to more inclusive and equitable outcomes. In doing so, they help prevent the reproduction of hegemonic practices and ensure that our efforts to preserve and engage with memory are genuinely transformative and just. </p>
<p>
Ultimately, integrating ethics into memory work ensures that our practices are not only effective but also aligned with the principles of respect, equity, and justice. This alignment is key to maintaining the integrity and impact of our efforts in the face of ongoing social and cultural challenges. </p>
<p>
<b>Me</b>. And now, about the last two points, they are the basis I've been using in my own work. Understanding memories as a woven fabric allows you not to see them in a "linear" way, but more in a tridimensional way, where every dot / node can be linked to many others in an infinity of possibilities. In this sense, chronology / time could be one of the criteria to understand the system, but there are many others, and all of them can provide different ways of approaching, reading, understanding and analyzing knowledge and memory. And, needless to say, the sensory dimension is essential, both when accessing knowledge and when disseminating it. </p>
<p>
<b>Eleonora</b>. Your approach to understanding memory as a woven fabric rather than a linear sequence offers a rich and nuanced perspective. Viewing memory in a multidimensional, interconnected way reflects the complexity of how we experience, interpret, and utilize knowledge. Each node or dot in this fabric represents a point of memory that can link to numerous others, creating a network of relationships and meanings that transcend a simple chronological or linear framework. </p>
<p>
This perspective allows for a more dynamic and flexible understanding of memory. By considering multiple criteria—such as cultural, emotional, or contextual factors—in addition to time, we can explore different dimensions of memory and knowledge. This approach enriches our ability to analyze and interpret information, offering diverse ways to approach and understand the interplay between past and present. </p>
<p>
The sensory dimension you mention is also crucial. Engaging with knowledge and memory through sensory experiences—whether visual, auditory, tactile, or otherwise—adds layers of depth to how we access and disseminate information. Sensory elements can enhance the emotional and experiential aspects of memory, making it more vivid and impactful. </p>
<p>
In summary, understanding memory as a complex, woven fabric that incorporates various dimensions and sensory experiences allows for a more holistic and nuanced engagement with knowledge. This approach not only broadens our analytical tools but also enriches our ability to connect with and convey the richness of human experience. </p>
<p>
<b>Me</b>. So, going back to my initial question: From where should we weave memories? From a critical, diverse, independent, resilient, resistant and community-committed position where we are open to understand knowledge and memories as a rich environment, full of potentials... </p>
<p>
<b>Eleonora</b>. Exactly. We should weave memories from a position that is deeply critical, diverse, and independent, while also being resilient and committed to community needs. This approach involves several key aspects: </p>
<p><ul>
<li>Critical Perspective: Embrace a critical stance that questions dominant narratives and power structures, challenging biases and assumptions in both memory preservation and knowledge creation.</li>
<li>Diversity and Pluralism: Approach memory work with an understanding of the rich tapestry of human experience. Recognize and include a wide range of perspectives, ensuring that diverse voices and histories are represented and valued.</li>
<li>Independence and Integrity: Maintain an independent and ethical stance, free from undue influence or external pressures that might compromise the authenticity and integrity of memory work.</li>
<li>Resilience and Resistance: Equip yourself with the resilience to confront and resist hegemonic forces, using memory as a tool to challenge injustices and advocate for social change.</li>
<li>Community Commitment: Engage actively with communities, incorporating their input and needs into the fabric of memory work. Ensure that efforts are grounded in grassroots development and responsive to the real-life contexts of the people involved.</li>
<li>Open and Dynamic Approach: View memory as a dynamic, multidimensional environment. Embrace its complexity and potential, exploring various criteria and sensory dimensions to fully understand and utilize the richness of knowledge and experiences.</li></ul></p>
<p>
By adopting this multifaceted approach, you ensure that memory work is not only robust and inclusive but also transformative and meaningful. This perspective allows for a deeper connection with the past, present, and future, enabling a richer and more impactful engagement with memory and knowledge. </p>
<p>
<b>Me</b>. Do you think librarians will be able to implements those points, those ideas? </p>
<p>
<b>Eleonora</b>. Implementing these ideas presents both significant challenges and exciting opportunities for librarians. Here’s a look at how these points might be approached in practice: </p>
<p><ul>
<li>Critical Perspective: Adopting a critical stance requires a cultural shift within libraries and similar institutions. Librarians may need training and support to question dominant narratives and confront biases in their practices. Institutional policies might need to evolve to support a more reflective and critical approach to knowledge and memory.</li>
<li>Diversity and Pluralism: Embracing diversity involves actively seeking out and incorporating various perspectives. This can be challenging but is achievable through targeted collection development, community engagement, and inclusive practices. Librarians can foster diverse collections and programs by working closely with underserved and marginalized communities.</li>
<li>Independence and Integrity: Maintaining independence and ethical integrity is essential but can be difficult in environments where funding and political pressures exist. Librarians can advocate for policies that protect their professional autonomy and ensure that their work remains unbiased and respectful of all perspectives.</li>
<li>Resilience and Resistance: Building resilience involves preparing for and addressing challenges from external pressures or institutional inertia. Librarians can cultivate resilience by forming supportive networks, engaging in advocacy, and embracing innovative approaches to problem-solving and resistance.</li>
<li>Community Commitment: Genuine community engagement requires ongoing dialogue and partnership with local populations. Librarians can work to ensure that their services and programs are responsive to community needs through regular feedback, collaboration, and adaptable practices.</li>
<li>Open and Dynamic Approach: Implementing a multidimensional approach to memory and knowledge involves flexibility and creativity. Librarians can explore new methods and technologies to enhance their practices and adapt their approaches based on evolving needs and insights.</li></ul></p>
<p>
In summary, while implementing these ideas may be challenging, it is certainly possible with commitment, support, and innovation. Many librarians and institutions are already working towards these goals, and ongoing efforts to promote these values can lead to transformative change in how memory and knowledge are managed and utilized. </p>
<p>
<b>Me</b>. Those elements are not frequent in the librarian community, although you're right: many librarians are doing that. But it seems to me more the exception than the rule. </p>
<p>
<b>Eleonora</b>. You’re right; these elements are often more the exception than the rule in the broader library community. There are several reasons for this: </p>
<p><ul>
<li>Institutional Inertia: Libraries, like many institutions, can be resistant to change due to established traditions, processes, and structures. Shifting towards more critical, diverse, and community-centered practices requires overcoming significant institutional inertia.</li>
<li>Training and Professional Development: Many librarians may not have received training or professional development in areas like critical thinking, diversity, or community engagement. Expanding these training opportunities can help integrate these elements more broadly.</li>
<li>Resource Constraints: Libraries often face budget constraints and other resource limitations, which can make it challenging to implement new and innovative practices. Prioritizing and allocating resources towards these areas can be a significant hurdle.</li>
<li>Professional Norms and Expectations: The traditional emphasis on neutrality and objectivity in librarianship can sometimes conflict with more active, critical, and engaged approaches. Changing these professional norms requires rethinking the role of librarians and their relationship to the communities they serve.</li>
<li>Resistance to Change: Even among those who recognize the need for these changes, there can be resistance or fear of the unknown. Building a culture of openness to innovation and reflection is essential for overcoming this resistance.</li></ul></p>
<p>
Despite these challenges, there are many examples of librarians and libraries successfully integrating these elements into their work. These examples can serve as models and inspire broader adoption. Advocacy, professional development, and a commitment to continuous improvement can help make these practices more common in the library community. </p>
<p>
Fostering a shift towards these more critical, diverse, and community-centered approaches requires collective effort and a willingness to challenge the status quo. By highlighting successful examples, advocating for change, and investing in professional development, the library community can work towards making these practices more prevalent and impactful. </p>
<p>
<b>Me</b>. Let's hope for the best, right? </p>
<p>
<b>Eleonora</b>. Absolutely. Hope and optimism are essential drivers of progress. With dedication, advocacy, and a willingness to embrace new ideas, there’s potential for meaningful change in the library community. By continuing to work towards these goals and supporting those who are leading the way, we can help create a more inclusive, critical, and dynamic field. Here's to a future where these principles become more widespread and transformative! </p>
<p>
<b>Me</b>. Thank you, Eleonora. It has been a nice conversation. See you next time, to continue it? </p>
<p>
<b>Eleonora</b>. You're welcome, Edgardo. I'm glad you found the conversation valuable. I look forward to continuing it next time. Have a great day, and see you soon! </p>
