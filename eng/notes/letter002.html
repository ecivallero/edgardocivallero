<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Historically, spaces for knowledge and memory management —whether labeled as libraries, archives, museums, or by any of the myriad of other names they might receive— have traditionally filled their shelves, boxes and filing cabinets with a certain type of document. A particular, specific, well-defined type. </p>
<p>
Traditionally, these spaces have reserved room for the great titles, the great authors (often white men), the great works (primarily academic), the great discourse (the dominant, the hegemonic), the great histories (the official, the victor's), and the great publishing houses. </p>
<p>
"Great" is the adjective common to all these nouns. The buildings were also great. Grandiose, rather. Imposing in appearance, size, and structure. Spaces of high culture and civilization. Places where the knowledge and memory of humanity found rest. </p>
<p>
But not all of them. Only the big ones. </p>
<p>
A significant portion of the intangible human heritage was left unacknowledged. Specifically, the "other" knowledge, the "small" stories and proposals, the "non-traditional" documents, the spoken word, the "voice of the vanquished"...</p>
<p>
At a certain moment, some spaces for the management of knowledge and memory adopted the adjective "small" as a banner, and we (and here I'll include myself because I was and still am an active part of that movement) began to propose other ways of working, thinking, and acting. We began to put our gaze on the details: the tiny papers, the seemingly insignificant anecdotes, those spaces erroneously labeled as "margins," the walls echoing through graffiti in the popular neighborhoods, the indigenous communities expressing themselves through their weavings, and all those "alternative" perspectives, ideas, and activities. </p>
<p>
In doing so, we discovered a universe hitherto invisible, silenced, kept in the shadows by force, and eventually forgotten. An immense accumulation of learning and experiences, dreams and failures, hopes and lived paths. Hundreds of millions of life stories that had never been considered by the "big" history, that had never appeared in the "big" publications, that had never graced the shelves of the "big" libraries or the boxes of the "big" archives. Yet, regardless of whose weight it may bear, these stories were also part of the intangible heritage of our species. </p>
<p>
This gave rise to community archives, indigenous libraries, rural museums, and many other initiatives that, in a certain way, decolonized spaces and processes, allowing numerous human groups to reclaim a voice that they had never truly lost but had, in one way or another, been taken away from them. </p>
<p>
Those professionals of knowledge and memory management ended up taking that perspective, that of putting the gaze on the details, to the large documents. And we discovered wonderful stories hidden in unknown corners. We gave ourselves the opportunity to look at those documents with different eyes, to touch them with different hands, to think about them from different places. And we were surprised. </p>
<p>
I was reminded of all this recently, thanks to a book donated to us as part of the collection of a retired scientist. It was an old copy, although quite well preserved. As I turned its pages, feeling the gentle rustle of the paper and the unmistakable scent of aged volumes, I stumbled upon a note in the margin. It was a form of what we call "marginalia," encompassing a wealth of expressions. </p>
<p>
This particular note underlined a specific sentence and, on the side, in pencil, and followed by several exclamation points, it noted, "Bullshit!" </p>
<p>
This was not the first time I encountered such a word at the edge of a book. "Marginalia" include numerous acts of rebellion, of dissent against the dominant discourse and "the big things." (After all, it is the voice that asserts itself from the margins and on the margins). On a prior occasion, when I encountered a similar note, I investigated the reason behind the outburst. And I discovered that the author of the annotation, a scientist, ended up publishing many years later an article in which, without directly referencing it, she demonstrated that, indeed, the statement in the annotated book was false. A lie. </p>
<p>
To put the gaze on the details, on the "small" things, on the everyday discourse and facts, is to grant oneself the opportunity to come across these stories — which are also part of the process of knowledge-building we refer to as "science". A process that always, invariably, begins with a question, stemming from our innate curiosity about the world around us. </p>
<p>
Days ago, while sorting through a set of papers received as part of the collection of a botanist at our institution, I came across a diary of hers. The year was 1990. As I attempted to turn the pages, the booklet opened precisely between two leaves where the owner had tucked a fern frond. Dry, there, for more than three decades. </p>
<p>
A trivial detail? Far from it. What impelled that woman to stop beside a fern, to snip a small portion of its "leaves," and to place the sample between the pages of her personal notebook? What question arose in her mind at that moment, what curiosity? Isn't that, ultimately, the primary driving force of scientific and academic endeavors? That sense of wonder, that curiosity about the unknown, that eagerness to delve deeper and explore? </p>
<p>
Yet there is more to it: an entire narrative. Would our scientist recall that she had that sample there? Would she be able to identify it? Could that small piece of fern have served as the catalyst for something greater? </p>
<p>
Putting the gaze on the details allows us to uncover stories of this nature. Incomplete, fragmentary, sometimes hypothetical, but stories, nonetheless. Some of my colleagues dismiss them as trivial, too insignificant. Perhaps they are. However, I always remember Lao Tzu's dictum that a journey of a thousand miles begins with a first step. Every big process is the sum of small elements: diverse, rich, unique, different, and plural. Elements that can offer alternative perspectives, a fresh outlook, or an unprecedented approach. </p>
<p>
Learning how to observe is essential. Or, at the very least, having the willingness to observe. And from there, fostering a willingness to be surprised. </p>
<p>
This forms the foundation of what we do — those of us who dedicate ourselves to what I do. And, if you ask me, it constitutes the essence of science itself. </p>

I know that they can burn books, raze libraries, ban languages, banish beliefs, erase pasts, erase presents, order futures, torture and execute people. But I also know that they have not yet discovered how to kill the intangible and luminous body of an idea, a dream, or a hope (E. Civallero. Head of the blog <i>Bitácora de un bibliotecario</i> between 2004 and 2014).</p>
