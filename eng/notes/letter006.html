"I was told to deliver them in person. In-per-son. So here they are, doctor" said the man, a colleague from the Operations area who always shows me the great kindness of calling me "doctor" despite the fact that I neither have such a title nor do I think I deserve that label. He arrived at my office, in the library, loaded with a couple of old wooden boxes and placed them carefully on one of the tables. He pointed out that these materials had originally been in the biological station that STRI maintains on Barro Colorado Island, shook my hand, and hurried off to other tasks, wishing me luck and hoping that the packages contained something interesting. </p>
<p>
And they did. Boy, they did. </p>
<p>
Over the past few months, I have built up a network of "old stuff providers" within STRI. I guess because so many people have discovered that I care for and appreciate these materials, they send them to me, or deliver them to me personally. And I'm happy. Absolutely happy. Peering into those artifacts and documents —items that sometimes have endured years of neglect and oblivion— is something similar, I assume, to what an archaeologist opening a tomb that has been closed for centuries must feel. </p>
<p><i>
[Who am I kidding? The archaeologist's stuff must be infinitely better. I'm soooo jealous...]</i></p>
<p>
I approached the table. The boxes had been varnished, but that had been a long time and many rains ago: the humidity of the Panamanian rainforest had removed their original shine and covered them with a solid, mildew-colored patina. The bronze metal latches had a greenish tinge to them, courtesy of an advanced oxidation, and gave off an aroma that stuck to my hands for half a day. I lifted the lid of the first box, the smallest one. Inside, I found an optical device that I immediately identified as a theodolite: a measuring instrument, similar to a small telescope, used by topographers and surveyors to measure distances and unevenness and thus draw maps and plans. </p>
<p>
A label on the inside of the lid indicated that the device in question had been produced by a company in Canada. Another label, smaller and attached to the wood by means of completely "fossilized" adhesive tape, indicated a year: 1935. </p>
<p>
"The Panama Canal was already finished," I thought, "What was this crap doing in Barro Colorado?" </p>
<p><i>
[My inner dialogues are not always very academic. There goes a warning...]</i></p>
<p>
And that's when the adventure began. The detective works. Lifting clues from that item, from its container, from its parts, to try to find out where it came from and what exactly it was used for. Finding small pieces and putting them together to try to produce a picture that, unlike what happens with traditional puzzles, I do not know beforehand. </p>
<p>
In this work, one identifies dots and then tries to connect them — not always with success, or in the right way, truth be told. The element one studies is always, unfailingly, part of something bigger: it is a knot in a gigantic web of human activities. Once one locates this knot in such a fabric, one can follow the threads that touch it, and through them, it is possible to identify people, institutions, research, stories, anecdotes, places and related times... </p>
<p>
And it is then, and only then, when everything makes sense. </p>
<p><i>
[With a lot of luck and the help of all the gods of Olympus and Valhalla].</i></p>
<p>
The theodolite I had in front of me had been used by someone to do something, in a particular place, at a particular time. Were there photos, diaries, notes, plans, blueprints, plans, directives, reports, illustrations, articles, books...? Probably that someone was part of a team, worked for an institution or organization. Surely, if he worked in Panama, he got knee-deep in mud, got eaten by mosquitoes and ticks, got soaked in the rain, slept on a cot somewhere, ate local dishes, sweated under these tropical skies... Maybe he got sick, maybe he got exhausted... If he was a foreigner, he may have written letters back home, telling all or part of his experiences... I already told you about "the people behind the things", didn't I? </p>
<p>
What is the point of preserving the artifact if we do not know its many stories, if we are unable to find and listen to (and learn from) what it has to tell us? </p>
<p>
There is a concept that is central, I would say essential, in the information sciences: that of "document". It is a much-discussed concept, even a disputed one, because what we professionals of these disciplines do in our daily work depends on its (broader or narrower) definition. The broadest, produced by Michael Buckland in the 1990s, states that any artifact or element capable of transmitting information should be considered a document. That is the one I use, based on my years of experience working in different and very diverse spaces in Latin America. But conventional librarianship tends to reject it: imagine that, if accepted, a Latin American library should include, among its collections, Andean textiles and altarpieces, urban graffiti, ceramics and baskets from the Amazon, Afro-Antillean hairstyles... </p>
<p><i>
[Can you imagine a library that complete, that diverse, that plural? Such awesomeness...]</i></p>
<p>
At a conference I gave a few years ago on this topic, a librarianship student raised his hand during Q&As and asked me if I was so naive as to believe that the ear tag of a cow going to the slaughterhouse was a document. I replied, calmly, that indeed it was. I told him that this label gave an account of the identity and destiny of a living being that was about to become a food product for people like him. That this label could be linked to many other documents: records, above all. That there were thousands of stories behind that label. </p>
<p>
The cataract of denigrations that followed my response is not reproducible in a decent space like this one... </p>
<p><i>
[Yes: believe it or not, librarianship conferences can be intense places].</i></p>
<p>
It happens that traditional librarianship still believes that libraries are places of "high culture" where only books and a few scholarly articles, theses and encyclopedias, have pride of place. Some other things may find their way to their shelves: maps, photos, films... But those items are "special collections". That is, they are not [as valuable as] books. </p>
<p>
And everything else is, in any case, "archival fodder". Or just trash: things we should not even worry about, much less preserve. </p>
<p><i>
[And here we would enter into a discussion of long standing and still without a definitive answer: why do we fragment our cultural heritage among libraries, archives and museums? And another, thornier one, which has to do with a question of colonialism: why do we still consider that "high culture" (or "truth") is stored in our libraries and that there should be no room for certain "trash"]?</i></p>
<p>
Going back to my idea of "document", the theodolite is one. A knot / node in a gigantic network of elements and relationships to be discovered and analyzed. Who knows what will be behind those rusty bronzes and those woods eaten by humidity? </p>
<p>
And if I extend that perspective and that proposal to each of the elements that we manage in the STRI library and archive... can you see the magnitude of the project? </p>
<p>
My head went back to the object before me. And it began to plan, on its own, the steps to be taken. I was to treat the wood with baking soda, vinegar and water to remove molds, with alcohol to treat certain stains and discolorations, and with lemon and olive oil to rehydrate and protect it. I was to unscrew and disassemble the metal parts of the case and immerse them in pure white vinegar, and rub them carefully to remove rust, and then protect them with mineral oil to prevent further deterioration. And I had to check the instrument itself: most probably the lenses were damaged and could not be used again, but at least I could recover, very slowly, the rest of the structure. And, in the meantime, I would start looking for data about the manufacturer, check if there were any records with serial numbers or patents, trust that there were sales notebooks in some archive dedicated to industrial history... </p>
<p>
Who knows? With a little luck and a lot of tenacity, I might be able to make that slightly musty and slightly rusty "document" that had just been handed to me "in person" talk. And, if I succeeded, maybe I could pull the end of that ball of yarn and unravel a big story. </p>
<p>
Or a small one. It doesn't matter. It would be, of course, a story all our own. </p>
<p>
That's where I am today. I'll let you know how it goes. Most likely, though, the next time I talk about this theodolite, it will be to extend a cordial invitation to come see it on display at the library. </p>
<p>
In-per-son. As it has to be. </p>

I know that they can burn books, raze libraries, ban languages, banish beliefs, erase pasts, erase presents, order futures, torture and execute people. But I also know that they have not yet discovered how to kill the intangible and luminous body of an idea, a dream, or a hope (E. Civallero. Head of the blog <i>Bitácora de un bibliotecario</i> between 2004 and 2014).</p>
