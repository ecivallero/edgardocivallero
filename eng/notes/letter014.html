<p>
Created and developed during the first quarter of the 20th century, the Barro Colorado Biological Station, located in the heart of Lake Gatún, in the Panama Canal, has been one of the most iconic and significant spaces in the history of tropical biology and conservation. And the American entomologist James Zetek was one of its key founders — in addition to being its "resident guardian" for many, many years.</p>
<p>
The history of the station since its inauguration has been told both in internal reports and in external books and articles, and is well documented. The history of its early years is a bit more complicated to uncover: several fragments scattered across diaries, reports, newspapers, and third-party sources must be recovered, and memories must be "woven" very carefully to create a narrative that, while consistent, still leaves many things up in the air.</p>
<p>
And the history of the idea behind all that —the one that led to the creation of the station, the "why" behind this space that eventually became an international reference— was mostly preserved in oral tradition. It was what the oldest of the old told, generally through references.</p>
<p>
Until recently, when I found, in the special collection of our library, a brief document of about six pages, original and unpublished, typewritten by James Zetek himself and titled <i>The History of Barro Colorado</i>. One of his most personal versions of the events, where he gathered part of his personal story and the evolution of "his" idea for a biological reserve in Panama.</p>
<p>
I had often wondered what Zetek thought of the entire Barro Colorado story. His name appeared many times in the papers and accounts of others —usually in the acknowledgments for his indispensable contribution to the development of the station— but very rarely had I been able to read it in his own voice, as I did in <i>The History of Barro Colorado</i>. It seemed to me that he had conducted an interview with himself. That he sought to have his version of events reflected somewhere.</p>
<p>
I share here some excerpts from the manuscript, directly transcript, respecting Zetek's personal writing style, sometimes informal and repetitive.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">

<p>
"The idea of establishing a biological preserve in the Canal Zone, available to our scientists for study, dates back to about December 1911, shortly after the writer arrived on the Isthmus as entomologist to the Sanitary Department of the Isthmian Canal Commission, to work under Colonel William Crawford Gorgas on problems related to malaria, yellow fever and bubonic plague [...]</p>
<p>
Upon arrival in the Canal Zone, a new world opened to him [...]. And it was right then when the idea of a biological laboratory in the tropics got its start. Everywhere there was destruction going on. Let us have a sizeable tract of undisturbed tropical forest set aside to remain undisturbed by man, where scientists can come and study [...].</p>
<p>
With the completion of the Panama Canal came the cry for economy, and among the many positions abolished was that of the entomologist [...]. The writer then became State Entomologist to the Republic of Panama, and while this was of relatively short duration, it enabled him to see much of the interior of Panama, and this only helped to make the idea of a biological preserve an obsession with him [...]. </p>
<p>
The idea of a biological preserve had to wait for better days. During the [First World] war, and immediately following it, were bad times for such projects. However, the writer obtained from [Panamanian] President [Belisario] Porras a choice area just opposite where now stands the United States Embassy [in Panama City], for the establishment of a Marine Biological Laboratory. What an opportunity this was, but lack of support left this project dormant. Today, at this spot, is a big statue of Balboa, rediscovering the Pacific [...].</p>
<p>
These years served as an impetus for the idea of a biological preserve. This, then, is the background without which it is very doubtful if such a preserve would ever have been established here.</p>
<p>
What follows is the rapid growth of this idea into reality. The writer was made a member of the Conservation of Natural Areas Committee of the Ecological Society of America. The National Research Council was deeply interested in research in the tropics. The Institute for Research in Tropical America was formed, and while it only had a paper status at the time, it played a very important role once Barro Colorado Island was set aside for research.</p>
<p>
February 1923 was an auspicious month. Three leading authorities came to the Canal Zone: Dr. William Morton Wheeler, Dean of Bussey Institution, Dr. Richard D. Strong, Professor of Tropical Medicine at the Harvard Medical School, and Dr. C. V. Piper, noted agrostologist of the U. S. Department of Agriculture [...].</p>
<p>
Wheeler and Piper shared the writer's laboratory, Wheeler interested largely in ants, and Piper in grasses. Wheeler, Piper and the writer made innumerable field trips together, and on many of these Strong was also present. Both on these field trips, and in the laboratory, these four discussed the writer's idea of a biological preserve. We decided it should be a large island, in the Canal Zone, and as undisturbed as possible. We felt that this was the place to have it because the Canal Zone was the focus of travel facilities, the preserve would be close enough to civilization, and very close to the best hospital facilities south of the Rio Grande. We also felt that such a preserve, when in operation, should provide meals and lodging for the scientists, thus relieving them of these two major chores, hence all of their time would be available for their research work. We also stressed the importance of 'safe' water supply. Anyone who has gone on expeditions into the tropics knows what these facilities mean. Was there such a sizeable undisturbed area?</p>
<p>
A friend of the writer, Mr. Bill Irwin, was with the land-lease division of the Panama Canal. Land in the Canal was being leased in parcels of from one to fifty hectares for such as wanted to engage in agriculture. It would, it was thought, provide more food, and also be a source of additional labor forces. Irwin surely would have the answer. It was Barro Colorado Island, right in the center of the Gatun Lake, bordering the Canal. Only about eight hectares of it on the south side were leased to settlers, and he would see to it that they would get off the island provided we would pay them for their improvements. Irwin gave us valuable suggestions.</p>
<p>
The four decided that the writer should address a letter to Governor [of the Canal Zone] J. J. Morrow, asking that the island be set aside for this special purpose. On the 17th of April, 1923, Governor Morrow issued an order to that effect. The vision became a reality. We now had six square miles of splendid tropical forest reserved for our biologists [...].</p>
<p>
For the past twenty-five years the writer has looked after the laboratory, a task which, despite the worries and trials, has been pleasant [...]. This, then, is only the introductory chapter of this history. The many hundreds of scientists who during these twenty-five years have been on the island, and who contributed almost 650 individual books and papers covering their studies, give the finest testimony of the island's worth in science."</p>

I know that they can burn books, raze libraries, ban languages, banish beliefs, erase pasts, erase presents, order futures, torture and execute people. But I also know that they have not yet discovered how to kill the intangible and luminous body of an idea, a dream, or a hope (E. Civallero. Head of the blog <i>Bitácora de un bibliotecario</i> between 2004 and 2014).</p>
