Identifying researchers clearly and unambiguously, and linking them unequivocally to their research, has been one of the great challenges of the bibliographic universe and the publishing industry. Differentiating, for example, all Chinese academics sharing a surname as widespread as Wang and working in a field as widespread as bioengineering has become a real headache. </p>
<p>
Until recently (2010), many international associations and journals were only able to link an author and his or her work through name, address, and institutional affiliation. But the latter two change, and names are not always unique: there are homonyms (people with the same or similar names) and variants (different forms of the same name, including abbreviations of the middle name or surname, etc.). </p>
<p>
ORCID has solved the problem. An acronym for Open Researcher and Contributor ID, ORCID is a unique and permanent 16-digit numerical identifier. Officially launched in October 2013, its function is similar to that of the ISBN for books or the DOI for digital articles: it acts as a disambiguation tool, a sort of "authority file" that establishes the identity of researchers and their personal and academic affiliations, provides a list of all the variants of their names that may have appeared in the literature over their years of production... </p>
<p>
...and presents an updated list of their publications. So, it can be said that ORCID also functions as an actual bibliographic reference platform. </p>
<p>
And that bibliographic list can be exported to other platforms, like Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, ResearchGate, or arXiv. </p>
<p>
The proposal is based on open code (available on GitHub under an MIT license) and open data. Such openness ensures transparency and, at the same time, facilitates innovation and reuse of resources. </p>
<p>
The entity that manages ORCID was founded around 2009, and brings together publishers, donors, and international institutions such as Nature Publishing Group, Wellcome Trust, or Cornell University. It is a non-profit organization, based on the work of a rich open community of collaborators. </p>
<p>
In short, the idea is to maintain a unique register of researchers, giving each one an identifier, and creating a method to link research activities and results to these numbers and names. </p>
<p><i>
[There are other international systems trying to provide IDs for researchers, e.g., Clarivate Analytics' ResearcherID, Scopus' Author ID, Google Scholar Citations' ID, ArXiv's Author ID, OpenAIRE's ID, or even ISNI, the International Standard Name Identifier. However, ORCID is the only one with is general, independent, and open source].</i></p>
<p>
To use the service, all you need to do is register at <a href="https://orcid.org/" target="_blank" alt="ORCID" title="ORCID">https://orcid.org/</a>, obtain an account, complete your profile... </p>
<p>
...and fill in the list of publications. Which is the most complex step. </p>
<p><i>
[A step that will be addressed in the next post of this series, which will be a very detailed text with much more technical details].</i></p>
<p>
ORCID has gained significant traction across the scholarly community, with over a thousand academic journals, including prominent publishers such as PLoS, Nature, and Elsevier publications, incorporating it into their manuscript submission systems for author identification. Universities, professional associations, conference and poster session organizers, libraries, publishers, and funding agencies, ranging from Wellcome Trust to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), have also embraced it as a standard identifier for researchers. </p>
<p>
Additionally, ORCID is a good start point for producing bibliometric indicators. </p>
<p>
The ORCID community is experiencing rapid growth and expansion. Researchers, institutions, publishers, and other stakeholders are increasingly recognizing the value of ORCID in promoting transparency and efficiency in scholarly communication. The evolution and developments within the ORCID community can be tracked through the website's live updates at <a href="https://www.ORCID.org/live" target="_blank" alt="ORCID" title="ORCID">www.ORCID.org/live</a>. </p>
<p>
ORCID is leaving a global mark. It's not just about solving the issue of name ambiguity: it has a profound impact on research communities worldwide. It facilitates academic mobility by providing a persistent identifier that transcends institutional affiliations. It has a role in standardizing identification and enhancing interoperability among different systems and platforms. It aligns with principles of open science and fosters collaboration, reproducibility, and knowledge sharing within the scientific community. And, finally, its integration with funding agencies streamlines grant application and reporting processes. </p>
<p>
If you still do not have an ORCID... what are you waiting for? And if you do, have you explored all its potentials? </p>

I know that they can burn books, raze libraries, ban languages, banish beliefs, erase pasts, erase presents, order futures, torture and execute people. But I also know that they have not yet discovered how to kill the intangible and luminous body of an idea, a dream, or a hope (E. Civallero. Head of the blog <i>Bitácora de un bibliotecario</i> between 2004 and 2014).</p>
