<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
In the previous post on this series (#01), I defined ORCID's role and its possibilities. One of them is its capacity to produce and maintain a list of a researcher's bibliographic production. The platform is not exactly a bibliographic reference manager (as Mendeley or Zotero can be), but it allows authors to maintain a basic and updated list of their publications. </p>
<p>
To do that, you can add works to your ORCID account manually. </p>
<p>
Or you can use several automatized import services, including CrossRef Metadata Search, DataCite, ISNI, OpenAIRE Explore, Redalyc, Scopus, and the MLA International Bibliography, among others.</p>
<p>
Ooooor... you can import your works into ORCID via a .bib file (BibTex), a format handled by many reference management services (Zotero, Mendeley, JabRef, Google Scholar, etc.).</p>
<p>
Spoiler alert: none of the methods mentioned above are absolutely fail-proof. Some of them can be messy. One of them can be a nightmare if you lack patience or are not very focused on details. You'll see.</p>
<p><b>
Manually</b></p>
<p>
To enter the items of your bibliographic list manually, go to your ORCID account, navigate to the "Works" section, click on the "Add" button, select the option "Add manually", and enter the details of your publications. One by one. </p>
<p><i>
[Yeap].</i></p>
<p>
Those details include fields organized in six areas. On the first area, "Work details", you are meant to choose "Work type" ("Publication", with 23 options, "Conference" with 3, "Intellectual property" with 5, and "Other" with 13), and add "Work title" (with an option for "Translated title"), "Work subtitle", "Journal title" (if necessary), "Publication date", and "Link".</p>
<p><i>
[Note that among the "Other" option at "Work type" are things as interesting as research technique, annotation, artistic performance, and even pre-prints! Such a comprehensive coverage reflects ORCID's commitment to representing the diverse range of research activities across disciplines and domains].</i></p>
<p>
On the second area, "Citation", you should choose your "Citation type" (BibTeX, APA, Chicago, Harvard, IEEE, MLA, Unspecified, Vancouver or RIS), and add "Citation" and "Citation description". In the third area, "Identifiers", you add "Work identifier" and choose one from a list (like URN, URI, SSRN, ISSN, ISBN, CTX...). </p>
<p><i>
[Don´t know what an identifier is? I'll comment about that in an upcoming post].</i></p>
<p>
In the fourth area, "Contributors", you choose your role in the work from a list called "Type of contribution", which includes 15 very interesting items, e.g. "data curation", "funding acquisition"... or just "writing – original draft". You can also "Add another contributor" besides yourself — your name will appear by default. The fifth area, "Other information" allows you to provide "Language used" and "Country of publication", and the final area, "Visibility", let you choose among "Everyone", "Trusted parties", and "Only me".</p>
<p>
So, as you can see, there is plenty of information to add. Including, yes, a citation. That's just to make sure that ORCID offers the bibliographic citation you want for your work in the style you want — as you want it to appear, and without any potential problem. </p>
<p><b>
Automatic import</b></p>
<p>
To perform an automatized import, go to your ORCID account, navigate to the "Works" section, click on the "Add" button, and choose the "Search and link" option. After selecting "Work type" and "Geographical area" from a drop-down list, you can choose the import service ("Search and link wizards") from the available options. </p>
<p>
At the moment, there are 17: from Airiti to The Lens. Don't worry: ORCID provides brief descriptions of each one, in case you're feeling adventurous and want to explore (or in case you suffer an episode of "What the #@!* is this?"...). </p>
<p>
The bad thing with automatic import is that there are tooooo many things that can go wrong in the process. So... you should check the references one by one once the import is finished. Yes, you may cry, if you want — it's part of the job, too. </p>
<p><b>
And a .bib file...</b></p>
<p>
Finally, to import a .bib file, export it from your favorite reference management tool (e.g. Zotero), go to your ORCID account, navigate to the "Works" section, click the "Add" button, and choose the option "Import BibTeX".</p>
<p>
A .bib file is the format produced by a reference software called BibTeX, a program created in 1985 and that cannot be found as a stand-alone piece: it is bundled with LaTeX, a system for typesetting documents. The format .bib is a plain-text file, and it is so good at doing its job (and so simple) that it has become very used by several reference-related systems and platforms. This is how "the inside" of a .bib file looks: </p>
<p class="cita">
@Book{abramowitz+stegun,<br />
 author = "Milton {Abramowitz} and Irene A. {Stegun}",<br />
 title = "Handbook of Mathematical Functions",<br />
 publisher = "Dover",<br />
 year = 1964, <br />
 address = "New York City",<br />
 edition = "ninth Dover printing, tenth GPO printing"<br />
}</p>
<p>
A .bib file can be produced automatically by a reference management tool (as stated above)... </p>
<p>
...or it can be created from a list of bibliographic references in a .doc file (Microsoft Word). A process that is, more-or-less, the bibliographic equivalent of jumping to the worst-rated Circle of Hell willingly. </p>
<p>
An online conversion tool can be used to go from .doc to .bib, but the results can be quite unpredictable (and when I say "quite" I mean it). In general, it is necessary to format the references correctly in MS Word, leaving a couple of blank lines between each one, copy and paste them into a tool like <a href="https://www.snowelm.com/~t/doc/tips/makebib.en.html" target="_blank" alt="MakeBib" title="MakeBib">MakeBib</a>, copy the result, paste it into Notepad, and save the file with a .bib extension. </p>
<p>
Going from .doc to .bib manually implies creating a structure in MS Word like the one I shared above — with each one of your references. Copy the final thing, paste it into Notepad, and save the file with a .bib extension. Getting it right may take some time and there may be some risk of making mistakes — and of throwing your laptop or keyboard through the closest window, in desperation. </p>
<p><i>
[I'll be talking a little bit more about the possibilities of .bib files in the next post of this series].</i></p>
<p><i>
[Additionally, if you need help with any of the processes and systems described above, please ask me... That is one of the many reasons I am here for!]</i></p>
<p><b>
More about ORCID</b></p>
<p>
Besides giving you all the options mentioned so far, ORCID also provides granular privacy controls, allowing you to customize the accessibility of your profile data. You can adjust the visibility settings for each item in your profile, specifying who can view and access your works, affiliations, funding, etc. </p>
<p><i>
[In order to manage your privacy settings, go to your account and access the profile settings].</i></p>
<p>
Finally, ORCID offers integration with a wide range of platforms and services, including but not limited to Web of Science, Figshare, and Impactstory. By linking your ORCID account with these platforms, you can streamline the exchange of content and information between them. </p>
<p>
[For example, linking ORCID with Web of Science enables automatic updating of publication records in the ORCID profile based on data from the Web of Science database. Integration with Figshare allows you to easily deposit research outputs from your ORCID profile into Figshare repositories. Impactstory integration provides additional features for tracking the impact of research outputs associated with your ORCID profile]. </p>
<p>
Sometimes, all the tools described here may seem to actually make things harder instead of easier. They fail, they change, they disappear, and they definitely do not understand that the shorter way from point A to point B is an old, simple, right line — they can achieve Olympian levels when complicating things. And most researchers simply don't have the time to deal with them. But, despite of their problems, these tools are quite necessary. I could say that they are even useful. And it is important to be at least familiar with them — especially with the import / export processes. We live in a world of planned obsolescence, and we never know when our favorite platform will disappear forever (with all our data inside). </p>
<p>
Now, are they actually efficient? Well... I'll let you decide! </p>

I know that they can burn books, raze libraries, ban languages, banish beliefs, erase pasts, erase presents, order futures, torture and execute people. But I also know that they have not yet discovered how to kill the intangible and luminous body of an idea, a dream, or a hope (E. Civallero. Head of the blog <i>Bitácora de un bibliotecario</i> between 2004 and 2014).</p>
