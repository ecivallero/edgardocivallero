<p>
One of the most interesting and effective ways to look out into the world at large (beyond academic horizons) and show the results of our work is through a blog.</p>
<p>
A blog (short for "weblog") is a sort of personal site on the World Wide Web. Blogs started out functioning as a sort of personal diary, organized by entries presented in reverse chronological order. Originally, the most interesting section of the blogs were not the posts themselves, but the list of resources presented in the sidebar: there, the author shared a sort of curated and annotated bibliography of websites and other valuable spaces on the topic s/he was interested in. Over time, blogs became platforms for the promotion and academic visibility of thousands of researchers and scientists.</p>
<p>
In fact, scientific blogging is a whole current within popular scientific literature, and among the tools provided by the famous "web 2.0" (or are we already in the 3.0? Or in the 4.0?), blogs are among the first places for their versatility, communication and interaction capacity, possibility of improvement, design, and a long "etcetera" of qualities.</p>
<p>
Today there are independent blogs, blogs hosted on personal websites, collaborative platforms that unite many blogs on a topic, and much, much more. There is only one limit to their possibilities: the imagination of their producers.</p>
<p>
There is a vast literature (in print and digital) geared toward novice and not-so-novice bloggers, and intended to guide blog publishers in terms of platforms, formats, rhythms, designs, and trends to consider. The big initial question, however, is: why blogging?</p>
<p>
Writing an online blog allows one to present, make visible, distribute, and promote one's own work; to discuss the work of others; or a combination of both. It is not necessary to work on finished pieces or research, nor to do so in a formal style: on the contrary, blogging allows a more relaxed tone, and facilitates the approach and presentation of unfinished work, stages, ideas, failed experiments, reflections and so on. </p>
<p>
In addition, the possibility of receiving comments on what is written allows a sort of informal peer-review that, in most cases, is frankly useful.</p>
<p><i>
[Although there are also many trolls on the loose...]</i></p>
<p>
For starters, it is necessary to choose a platform. The most traditional ones are Blogger and WordPress, accompanied by Tumblr (for visually oriented blogs) and Squarespace. However, nowadays, platforms such as Medium, Plume, WriteFreely, Ghost, Anchor, Sigle, Imprint or GitHub (and Jekyll) can be used. There are blog networks specifically oriented to the sciences, such as the French network Hypothèses. And there are "blog" spaces on systems such as LinkedIn, which maintains Pulse as a place to write articles.</p>
<p>
In general, these platforms allow writing and publishing without writing code. It is the system known as WYSIWYG ("What You See Is What You Get"): you write, give it a basic format, add photos and links, and upload it to the web. And that's it.</p>
<p><i>
[Some of them allow, in certain cases, to write the HTML code, the basic structure of any web site on the Internet, and to modify the CSS code, which is the system that provides the style to those sites. But explaining that far exceeds the scope (and length) of these brief notes of mine].</i></p>
<p>
After selecting the desired platform (and for the management of each one of them there are countless online tutorials and specialized books, with detailed instructions), a good name should be chosen. And this is an important step: we are showing ourselves, we are establishing our digital identity, we are presenting ourselves to the world, so a good title for our "home on the Net" is essential. Short, interesting, eye-catching, catchy...</p>
<p><i>
["Resultón", as we say in my homeland].</i></p>
<p>
And then we decide how often we are going to publish (weekly, fortnightly...) and what characteristics the entries or posts will have in terms of structure, images, number of words, etc.</p>
<p><i>
[Short entries have less depth but a wider scope: they reach more people, who, in a world overloaded with digital stimuli, tend to prefer short, graphic readings. Longer posts have more depth but a narrower scope: they are aimed at an audience really interested in reading more details. Finding the perfect balance, or alternating between the two types of posts, is an entire art].</i></p>
<p>
The anatomy of a perfect post has already been analyzed (Lee, 2014). Titles should be eye-catching and effective (Seiter, 2014). Images are helpful, especially if pics can be found on platforms like Flickr, or other free-to-use spaces (Seiter, 2018). And Google analytics (Foote, 2012) can be used to evaluate the impact and adjust our blogging activity.</p>
<p>
Having texts prepared in advance is usually advisable. All the writings that are produced can be used, in a sort of "low-cost blogging": notes from a conference, a detailed e-mail response, the answer to a popular question, interesting code, discoveries made while surfing the Internet... Fragments of forthcoming articles can be shared, in a sort of "use of pre-prints". You can show essays, your own reflections, some personal experiences...</p>
<p>
In addition to being a good platform for dissemination, blogs force their authors to maintain a writing rhythm and improve their style, to choose proper headlines and illustrations, to structure ideas... It is an excellent writing practice (in an "informal" and relaxed context) that can very well work as a prelude to the production of longer and more complex texts.</p>
<p><i>
[More than twenty years ago, when I started writing my own blog on librarianship (the third in the history of weblogs in Spanish, and still active), writing on such platforms was a mere pastime, and the contents published on them were neither respected nor respectable. Today things have changed, and blogs can be cited in a bibliography as an absolutely valid reference source].</i></p>
<p>
Once the blog entries have been published, the dissemination of them begins. But that will be the subject of my next note in this series.</p>

I know that they can burn books, raze libraries, ban languages, banish beliefs, erase pasts, erase presents, order futures, torture and execute people. But I also know that they have not yet discovered how to kill the intangible and luminous body of an idea, a dream, or a hope (E. Civallero. Head of the blog <i>Bitácora de un bibliotecario</i> between 2004 and 2014).</p>
