<p>
Travel diaries have always been among the most incredible bestsellers in world literature.</p>
<p>
Throughout the centuries, the travel expectations of the vast majority of the human population were limited to the surroundings of their hometown and, with luck, perhaps a market in the neighboring town. And that was it.</p>
<p>
Thus, travel has always been among the most sought-after narratives by audiences hungry for stories. And there is nothing we, humans, like and that moves us more than a good story: from the "odyssey" of Ulysses, sung by the <i>aedas</i> of archaic Greece to the tune of a lyre...</p>
<p><i>
[The term "odyssey" comes from the original name of the character of "The Odyssey", Odysseus, and his long and tumultuous journey across the Mediterranean Sea].</i></p>
<p>
...and the adventures of Gilgamesh, to the travels of Marco Polo and the chronicles of Spanish conquistadors, passing through the Nordic <i>Eddas</i> and sagas, and the <i>Rihla</i> of Ibn Battuta.</p>
<p>
Of course, if the journey was accompanied by adventures and exotic landscapes, the tale sold better. And, after the advent of the printing press, "selling" was literal. The British privateers (better known as "pirates," though there is a technical difference between the two terms) who ravaged the Caribbean and, crossing the Isthmus of Panama or rounding Cape Horn, did the same with the waters of the Latin American Pacific, when those lands were still Spanish colonies, knew this well. Lionel Wafer, William Dampier, Basil Ringrose, and Raveneau de Lussan recorded adventures —many of them taking place in what is now Panama— that eventually sold like hotcakes to an audience hungry for strange descriptions, incredible events, and much, much exoticism.</p>
<p>
The naturalists of the 18th and 19th centuries took advantage of the general public's taste for logs and diaries to narrate and spread their journeys... and gain some notoriety. Charles Darwin, the great Alexander von Humboldt, Alfred Russell Wallace, Thomas Belt, and Richard Spruce wrote and published (with varying degrees of success) accounts of their wanderings through the Americas and the tropics.</p>
<p>
But they were not the only ones. Actually, the publishing industry preferred the less formal / academic and more... "scandalous" accounts, especially those produced by "common folk," like the readers themselves: a sailor, a railroad worker, a governess...</p>
<p>
...or a gold seeker.</p>
<p>
The sadly famous "Gold Rush" of California (1848-1855) was an important and interesting period in the history of the West Coast of the United States. For the merchants and prospectors on the US Atlantic coast who wanted to reach the other side of the country (at a time when the Transcontinental Railroad did not yet exist, having been inaugurated in 1869), it was much easier to take a ship to Central America, cross Panama or Nicaragua —the most popular routes of the time— and, once on the Pacific coast, take another ship to reach the city of San Francisco. Many pamphlets, flyers, stories, and novels were published about the "golden fever" at that time. One of them was <i>California Illustrated: Including a Description of the Panama and Nicaragua Routes</i>, written by a certain John M. Letts and published in New York by R. T. Young in 1853.</p>
<p><i>
[An original copy of the book is held in our library's special collection].</i></p>
<p>
Letts' book served as a travel guide, describing the two possible routes, and narrated both the potential problems and the local landscapes, territories, and characters. And all the anecdotes, events, and details that the author's more or less inspired (or imaginative) pen could manage to collect. Generally, the more scandalous and sensational, the better.</p>
<p>
I bring up Letts' book because it has a chapter dedicated to the city of Panama. And an illustration!</p>
<p>
A chapter that begins with a description of Panama from the ship...</p>
<p>
"The city, nestling cozily at the base of Cerro Lancon, looks enchantingly, her towers and domes being lighted up by the morning sun. Her dilapidated monasteries are also seen, and her extended wall, the base of which is washed by the gentle surf. That distant tower, shrouded in ivy, dripping with the morning dew, seems weeping over the tomb of a departed city. Everything conspired to awaken emotions of the most romantic character" (p. 185).</p>
<p>
Ah, those towers covered in ivy bathed in dew! Such semi-Gothic romanticisms could not be missing from the literature of the time, even though in Panama, the morning dew and the ivy did not exist, or bore no resemblance to those of more northern latitudes. </p>
<p>
Nor could detailed descriptions of promenades and places be left out...</p>
<p>
"After supper, we strolled to the 'Battery', seated ourselves on a brass fifty-six [cannon] and viewed one of the most magnificent moonlight scenes I ever beheld. The bay was as placid as a mirror; the ships lying quietly at anchor, loomed up like phantoms; the islands being just visible in the distance. Behind us was a ruined monastery, the moon looking in at the roof and windows, disclosing the innumerable bats that nightly congregate to gambol through these halls of desolation. After spending an hour here, we passed through one of the dilapidated gateways and took a surf bath; we reentered through the gateway, and passed along the wall to the convent of San Francisco, an immense structure covering an area of 300 feet square; it is now untenanted, and in ruins. Near one corner of this, standing in the street, is a stone pedestal surmounted by a cross, where the devout are wont to kneel and kiss the image of 'Nuestro Señora.' Passing up the main street, 'Calle de Merced,' we found the citizens all out enjoying the evening; and as we passed we could hear them modestly whisper, 'Los Americanos tienen mucho oro'" (p. 186).</p>
<p>
And, of course, the eerie touch...</p>
<p>
"There are many things here to attract and awaken interest in the mind, but no matter how strong the desire for information, nothing can be learnt from the lower classes of the population. The source of information which, in the States, is inexhaustible, is here barren; for to say that a New Grenadian even knows his own wife and children, is awarding him, comparatively, a very high degree of attainment. Pass and inspect the ruins of a monastery or other edifice, and ask the first person you meet what it is, and what the cause of its destruction. The invariable reply is, 'no sabio, Señor.' In passing along near the head of 'Calle San Juan de Dio,' my attention was attracted by the movements of a little girl who, with a lighted taper in her hand, passed rapidly along to an elbow in the main wall of the city, and leaving her light, hastily retreated. Upon inspecting the spot, I discovered that part of the wall was laid up of human skulls, and removing a stone that closed up an aperture, I saw a burning taper which is kept here as an 'eternal light.' I stepped into a small store near and inquired the history of this catacomb; the response was 'no sabi, Señor.' My solution was that they were the bones of heroes who had fallen in the defense of the city" (p. 187).</p>
<p>
Travel diaries, logbooks, and other similar narratives that include the current Panamanian territory in their pages are more than abundant: Panama has been, since the Spanish conquest, a land of passage and a meeting point for explorers, discoverers, travelers, and all sorts of curious individuals. In this literature, one can find more or less detailed, artistic, and fortunate descriptions of roads, towns, cities, ports, and people. And although, in general, the contributions of these texts to history, geography, or ethnology are neither broad nor deep, it is worth considering them. You never know when an unexpected surprise might appear on one of those pages.</p>
<p>
Like the comment that the old Panama wall was built on a base of human skulls. Doesn't that leave you wondering, now?</p>

I know that they can burn books, raze libraries, ban languages, banish beliefs, erase pasts, erase presents, order futures, torture and execute people. But I also know that they have not yet discovered how to kill the intangible and luminous body of an idea, a dream, or a hope (E. Civallero. Head of the blog <i>Bitácora de un bibliotecario</i> between 2004 and 2014).</p>
