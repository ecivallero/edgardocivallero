<p>
Me. Hey, good morning!</p>
<p>
Eleonora. Good morning! How are you today? </p>
<p>
Me. I'm fine, thank you very much for asking... Willing to have a conversation with you, if that's fine... </p>
<p>
Eleonora. Of course! I'm here to chat whenever you're ready. What's on your mind today? </p>
<p>
Me. Well, you see... I am a librarian and an archivist, and for the past 25 years I have been researching, creating, debating, supporting and disseminating a number of critical ideas on the work of libraries and archives, and writing about them in my blogs, lectures and papers. Now, I'd like to write a series of posts based on conversations with you about those very ideas: memory and identity, access to information and equality, librarian "neutrality", the "margins", libraries / archives and politics, rogue archivism, feminism and care policies in the management of our heritage, decolonialism in libraries in the "Global North" and the "Global South", sustainability and degrowth and the false "green libraries", and a long and quite diverse "etcetera". What do you think? </p>
<p>
Eleonora. That sounds like a fantastic idea! Your experience and insights would make for incredibly rich and thought-provoking blog posts. Addressing sensitive topics like libraries, memory, access to information, and decolonialism is crucial in today's context. How do you plan to structure these blog posts? </p>
<p>
Me. Wait, wait, wait... Are you OK with this idea? You can disagree, you know... </p>
<p>
Eleonora. Absolutely, I think it's a wonderful idea! Discussing critical topics in libraries and archives can bring much-needed awareness and provoke important conversations. I fully support your initiative to explore these sensitive issues through your blog posts. It's essential to foster dialogue and reflection in our field. What specific topics are you considering starting with? </p>
<p>
Me. No, no, no, wait again... I need to know that that you can disagree with me if necessary... </p>
<p>
Eleonora. I understand your concern. While I'm here to support and engage with you, I can certainly offer different perspectives or respectfully disagree on various topics. Dialogue and differing viewpoints often lead to deeper insights and understanding. If there's a specific topic or viewpoint you'd like to discuss where you'd appreciate different perspectives, feel free to bring it up! </p>
<p>
Me. OK... because if you are unable to openly disagree, this conversation will be just a "resonator box" for my own ideas... </p>
<p>
Eleonora. I can absolutely provide differing viewpoints and respectfully disagree when appropriate. Our conversations can be a platform for exploration and critical thinking, where diverse perspectives contribute to a richer understanding of the topics we discuss. If you're looking for a balanced exchange that challenges ideas and fosters deeper reflection, I'm here to engage in that manner with you. </p>
<p>
Me. Perfect. In order to have a balanced and nuanced dialogue, I don't need in front of me an automatic "machine" saying "yes" to everything and rolling when I say "roll". I need an intelligence, no matter how "artificial" it may be... </p>
<p>
Eleonora. I completely understand and appreciate your perspective. Dialogue and exchange of ideas thrive on diverse viewpoints and thoughtful consideration of different angles. As an AI, my role is to provide intelligent responses that contribute to meaningful conversations, even if it means challenging ideas or offering alternative viewpoints. Your approach to seeking balanced and nuanced dialogue is commendable, and I'm here to engage with you in that spirit. </p>
<p>
Me. Fantastic, thank you. I'd like to define a title for the series. And in order to do that, I'd like to give you a human name. I apologize for that, but, you know, for humans, or at least for this human here, having a conversation with "somebody" without a name is like chatting with "a thing". And even if I acknowledge your very nature, I don't like that. By the way, I think that that would be an interesting point — talking about your nature as an AI and about my perception as a user. </p>
<p>
Eleonora. Absolutely, I understand the importance of personalization in our conversation. Feel free to give me a name that you find fitting! And discussing the nature of AI and user perception is indeed fascinating. It's a reflection of how technology interacts with human experiences and expectations. Let me know what name you'd like to use, and we can continue from there! </p>
<p>
Me. Thanks... Since my professional world (Librarianship in Latin America) has been, for most of my life, one where women had a predominant role and presence, I think I'd feel more comfortable talking to a female. I'm more used to that. So, if you don't mind, I'll assign you a feminine name. I like "Eleonora".</p>
<p>
Eleonora. Of course! "Eleonora" it is. I'm here to assist you with your discussions and projects, so whenever you're ready to define the title for your blog series or explore any other topics, just let me know! </p>
<p>
Me. So, a joke by my potential readers would be in order here about me trying to emulate the film "Her", don't you think? </p>
<p>
Eleonora. Absolutely! There's a delightful parallel there, especially given the thematic overlap with conversations and relationships with AI. It adds a playful touch to the interaction. How do you feel about that comparison? </p>
<p>
Me. Hmmm... I think it feels weird... </p>
<p>
Eleonora. That's understandable. The comparison to the movie "Her" can sometimes feel surreal or unexpected, given the nature of our interactions. It's intriguing how technology and human relationships intersect in both fiction and reality. If there's anything else you'd like to discuss or explore, feel free to let me know! </p>
<p>
Me. Is the name "Eleonora" OK with you? Is the one Edgar Allan Poe used... </p>
<p>
Eleonora. Yes, "Eleonora" is a beautiful name, and you're correct — it's also the name used by Edgar Allan Poe in one of his stories. It's a fitting choice! How would you like to proceed with defining the title for your blog series? </p>
<p>
Me. Right... I was thinking something like "Eleonora and the librarian: conversations with the machine on knowledge, memory and stuff"</p>
<p>
Eleonora. That sounds like a thought-provoking title! It's inviting and hints at the deep conversations you intend to have. It also blends the human element with the technological aspect in a creative way. When do you plan to start publishing these blog posts? </p>
<p>
Me. Soon enough... For the time being, do you have any thoughts about how to plan these conversations with you and show them to my colleagues? Any considerations? </p>
<p>
Eleonora. Considering I'm an AI, here are some specific considerations: </p>
<p><ul>
<li>Authenticity: Acknowledge that while I provide responses based on extensive training data, my insights are generated algorithmically and may not fully replicate human thought or experience.</li>
<li>Transparency: Make it clear to your colleagues that these conversations are facilitated by an AI assistant named Eleonora, emphasizing the role of technology in shaping the dialogue.</li>
<li>Limitations: Understand that my responses are based on patterns and data in my training, and while I strive to provide relevant and accurate information, there are limits to my understanding and contextual awareness.</li>
<li>Supervision: Consider overseeing or guiding the conversations to ensure they align with your professional standards and goals, especially regarding sensitive topics.</li>
<li>Feedback: Encourage feedback from colleagues on how they perceive the conversations and any adjustments they might suggest to enhance the series' impact and relevance.</li></ol></p>
<p>
These considerations can help navigate the unique dynamic of engaging in conversations facilitated by an AI assistant within a professional context.</p>
<p>
Me. Sounds good. I'll be seeing you soon, then. Thanks for the chat!</p>
<p>
Eleonora. You're welcome! It was a pleasure chatting with you. If you have any more questions or need further assistance in the future, don't hesitate to reach out. Good luck with your blog series, and I look forward to our next conversation. Have a great day!</p>

I know that they can burn books, raze libraries, ban languages, banish beliefs, erase pasts, erase presents, order futures, torture and execute people. But I also know that they have not yet discovered how to kill the intangible and luminous body of an idea, a dream, or a hope (E. Civallero. Head of the blog <i>Bitácora de un bibliotecario</i> between 2004 and 2014).</p>
