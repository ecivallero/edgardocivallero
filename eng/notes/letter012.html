"Please keep this folder always in the library room, on the table. Do not remove it from the library".</p>
<p>
This is how a curious document I just found this week in our special collection begins, while I was conducting a (very necessary) inventory. A very particular, original, and unique typewritten document, produced by James Zetek, the custodian of Barro Colorado Island biological station, in 1951.</p>
<p>
The text is titled "Information for Scientists," and in its sixty-some pages, it covers everything a visitor needed to know upon arriving at Barro Colorado in that era: from basic rules to payments and invoices, purchases, water and electricity usage, train schedules, use of the herbarium, the library, the laboratory, the dining hall, and the darkroom, to mailing services, specimen collection, and even some survival tips for the forest.</p>
<p>
The last section is dedicated to ticks. I liked it so much that I decided to share it in full with you.</p>
<p>
So, here are Zetek's paragraphs. Written over seven decades ago, but still useful today.</p>
<p>
[The photograph features James Zetek, was taken by Alexander Wetmore in 1946, and is currently housed in the SI Archives.]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>
Ticks and red bugs</b></p>
<p>
Ticks are very plentiful during the dry season, red bugs in the wet season. Ticks you can see, but the very minute "seed" ticks, that is, the very young, are hard to see and very abundant. They are on the tips of grasses, etc. Red bugs you don't see, but feel. There are some people that are little attacked by red bugs or ticks. </p>
<p>
The bigger ticks are easy to remove when crawling. Seed ticks, because of their very small size, are harder to remove because they are harder to see. All ticks work upward, hence, insofar as your skin is concerned, the vulnerable areas to protect are the region of the ankle, the waist, and the wrists. Dress against ticks. Tuck your pant legs into your socks and then sprinkle heavily with powdered sulphur. Carry with you a "tick-ball" which I devised in 1923 and still consider efficient. This is bees wax with pine oil added. If you keep it in the hand, the body heat will keep it soft. Stop occasionally and go over yourself by tapping each crawling tick you see with the tick-ball. The ticks will become imbedded in the wax. If there are any crawling in your skin use the tick-ball, and the bit of pine oil that stays on the skin will help you to prevent scratching.</p>
<p>
You may have used "622" [insect repellent used during WWII in jungles, made mostly of dimethyl phthalate] and you may like it. It is good, but I do not like to smear it over my flesh. It is good to spray on your pant legs. Or you can dip the pant legs in water made soapy with "Tide" [laundry detergent originally designed foe heavy duty machine cleaning] into which you have added the "622" and many believe this is excellent.</p>
<p>
But if you tuck your pant legs in your socks, use powdered sulphur, use a belt and powder the belt-line with sulphur, and if ticks are very bad, de-tick with a tick-ball, you will find that this answers well the purpose.</p>
<p>
We recommend when you come in from the forest that you change trousers, and go over yourself for ticks, using the tick-ball. And also, de-tick your field clothes. Stretch a strong cord between two posts. Make out of wire "S" shaped hooks. Put the hooks on this cord and suspend your field clothes from the S-hooks. Since ticks crawl upward, by next morning practically all of them will be congregated on the S-hooks and your field clothes are deticked. But you must drop the S-hooks into a jar with alcohol.</p>
<p>
Eventually, when we have more of electricity, we plan to have a room heated to above 140 degrees Fahr., where you can hang your field clothes and bake the ticks to death.</p>
<p>
In going over your body for ticks, team work is often needed to get ticks where you can't see them or reach them.</p>
<p>
Once the ticks stick their mouthparts into your flesh, as they eventually will, you have another problem, which leads to itching. A method we found worthwhile is to wet the tick with your saliva and then rotate the tick with your finger, and you will "work" it loose and not leave the mouthparts in the flesh to cause festering.</p>
<p>
A shower bath will remove free ticks, and some that are just attached, and also will help with red bugs, is splendid IF you do it right. The ritual is as follows: open shower and slowly count to three. Close shower. Soap yourself well (lifebuoy [a brand of soap created in 1895] is very good) and when well lathered, open shower to take off the soap and count to ten. This is ample to de-soap. Shut off shower. If you prefer longer baths, use the lake. We do not have enough water storage to allow for extended showers. Of course I know that this "system" is hardly ever followed to the letter.</p>
<p>
For red bugs no remedy is better than "don't scratch". There are any number of "remedies". The following one is fine if you have patience. Take a piece of cotton, wet it with chloroform, put it over the tiny red dot, cover with finger, and hold it until it feels real warm. Remove and go to the next spot. Rubbing alcohol is also good. Do not use menticol [refreshing lotion to avoid itching] or other cooling lotions over large areas because of the cooling effect. The "Zetek" liniment [?] is ok, but be sure you rub it till it is dry, do not put cloth over an area still wet with the liniment, because it will burn.</p>
<p>
If you can't help it, and scratch until the hide is denuded, you have a problem worse than the red bug. In such a case, Abbott's Butesin picrate [Australian ointment, applied to skin lesions as a topical anesthetic, analgesic, and antiseptic] is excellent unless you are one of the very few sensitive to picrates. Or, you can paint small areas with the following: Tincture of Benzoin Compound [invented ca. 1760 and sometimes called "Friar's Balsam"] one part, tincture of iodine one part.</p>
<p>
I have known individuals (myself included) who go into the forest in shorts and ticks and red bugs do not seem to bother them much — probably in part because when they come in they go over themselves for ticks and use rubbing alcohol on legs and feet. And others, with all precautions, come back loaded.</p>

I know that they can burn books, raze libraries, ban languages, banish beliefs, erase pasts, erase presents, order futures, torture and execute people. But I also know that they have not yet discovered how to kill the intangible and luminous body of an idea, a dream, or a hope (E. Civallero. Head of the blog <i>Bitácora de un bibliotecario</i> between 2004 and 2014).</p>
