This note is part of a series that challenges the status quo of "green libraries," exposing greenwashing and tokenism, and exploring viable alternatives, such as minimalism, degrowth, upcycling, and "slow libraries." Check all the notes in this section's <a href="../notes.html" title="Notes" alt="Notes">index</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>
Introduction</b></p>
<p>
Minimalism is a philosophy that champions simplicity, intentionality, and the reduction of excess. It challenges the conventional wisdom that more is inherently better by emphasizing quality, efficiency, and deliberate resource use.</p>
<p>
For libraries —institutions historically celebrated for their ever-expanding collections and continuous growth— a minimalist approach calls for a radical rethinking of how knowledge is curated, spaces are managed, and resources are consumed. In this post I argue that by adopting minimalism, libraries can not only reduce their environmental impact but also align with broader ethical and ecological movements that value sustainability over relentless expansion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>
Reforming Collection Policies</b></p>
<p>
Traditionally, libraries have been known for their vast collections — a repository of cultural richness and intellectual heritage. Yet in today's era of hyper-production, where new titles are published at an unprecedented pace, libraries are inundated with an overwhelming volume of books.</p>
<p>
This relentless accumulation strains storage capacities and drives up the energy required for climate control and maintenance, perpetuating unsustainable cycles of consumption and waste. A minimalist approach to collection development means rethinking how resources are selected and maintained.</p>
<p>
Instead of indiscriminately adding more items, libraries can implement rigorous selection criteria that prioritize relevance, longevity, and community value. Regular weeding processes can remove duplicates, outdated materials, and underused items, ensuring that collections remain dynamic, focused, and environmentally responsible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>
Streamlining Energy Use and Daily Operations</b></p>
<p>
Minimalism extends well beyond collections to every facet of a library's operation. </p>
<p>
Modern libraries face high energy demands driven by extensive lighting, HVAC systems, and digital infrastructures. By embracing an operational minimalist model, libraries can rigorously review their practices and eliminate wasteful processes. For example, investing in smart lighting that adjusts based on occupancy and natural light, as well as modern climate control systems, can dramatically reduce energy use. Rethinking space design to maximize natural light and airflow further reduces reliance on artificial systems. </p>
<p>
Such measures not only cut costs but also lower the overall environmental footprint, reflecting a genuine commitment to sustainable practices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>
Connecting Minimalism to Broader Ecological and Ethical Movements</b></p>
<p>
At its essence, minimalism is a direct challenge to the consumerist culture that equates progress with endless accumulation. It questions whether true advancement is measured by how much is added rather than by how wisely resources are used. </p>
<p>
For libraries, adopting minimalism means aligning with movements like degrowth and the circular economy, which advocate for restraint and long-term ecological balance. This philosophical shift also addresses issues of equity and justice, as it calls into question the environmental costs of overconsumption — a burden that often falls disproportionately on vulnerable communities. In this way, minimalism is not merely a practical strategy; it is an ethical stance that redefines what it means to be sustainable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>
Practical Steps Toward Minimalism in Libraries</b></p>
<p>
Implementing minimalism in practice requires a comprehensive reexamination of both policy and operations. </p>
<p>
Libraries must first reframe their acquisition strategies. Instead of pursuing endless expansion of their collections, institutions can focus on thoughtful curation. Every new acquisition should be evaluated not only for its immediate utility but also for its long-term relevance and durability. Institutionalizing regular weeding sessions ensures that only resources with sustained value remain, reducing both physical clutter and the environmental costs associated with storage.</p>
<p>
In parallel, libraries should reimagine their physical infrastructure. Rather than constructing new facilities to accommodate growing collections, they can focus on the adaptive reuse of existing spaces. Retrofitting older buildings with energy-efficient technologies, enhancing natural lighting, and improving insulation can dramatically reduce energy consumption while preserving cultural heritage. Similarly, as digital collections grow, balancing this expansion with sustainable digital practices —such as optimizing server usage and investing in green energy for data centers— becomes essential.</p>
<p>
Moreover, libraries have the power to influence their communities by fostering a culture of sustainability. Hosting workshops on repair, upcycling, and resource conservation can empower patrons to adopt minimalist practices in their own lives. By integrating sustainability into programming and community engagement, libraries become living models of the ethical, resource-conscious lifestyle that minimalism promotes. </p>
<p>
Finally, from procurement to daily operations, every decision can be guided by the mantra of "less is more." Opting for durable, repairable products and resisting the lure of rapid technological obsolescence transforms libraries from passive repositories into active advocates for a sustainable future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>
Breaking Free from Token Sustainability</b></p>
<p>
The superficial allure of token sustainability measures has long masked the deeper issues of overconsumption and waste. Minimalism, by contrast, offers a transformative alternative that calls for deliberate choices and structural change. </p>
<p>
By rethinking collection policies, streamlining operations, and integrating sustainable practices into every facet of their work, libraries can significantly reduce their environmental impact and serve as powerful models for ethical resource management. </p>
<p>
In a world of finite resources, the power of less is not about sacrificing access to knowledge; it is about redefining progress in terms of efficiency, quality, and long-term balance. Libraries that embrace minimalism become beacons of true sustainability, inspiring broader societal shifts toward a more equitable and ecologically sound future.</p>

I know that they can burn books, raze libraries, ban languages, banish beliefs, erase pasts, erase presents, order futures, torture and execute people. But I also know that they have not yet discovered how to kill the intangible and luminous body of an idea, a dream, or a hope (E. Civallero.
