<p>
All stories, our stories, the biggest and the smallest, have actresses and actors. Main and secondary characters who participate in them, who develop them, who interpret them, who conclude them: heroes or villains, noble or base, comedic or tragic. </p>
<p>
It is thanks to these people, their actions and searches, and their stumbles or victories, that this enormous and plural narrative called "History" has been moving since humans have existed. </p>
<p>
Those of us who manage knowledge and memory —whether in libraries, archives, museums, or any other similar and equivalent space— know these actresses and actors well. And we have learned (the hard way, not because anyone has explained or taught us) that there are always great figures who occupy the entire screen or stage, and others who remain behind. Sometimes out of focus and out of the credits. Behind the curtain. </p>
<p>
Finding out and understanding that these characters were present in a specific scene, at a particular moment in history (or in several) is sometimes extremely difficult. No one speaks of them; there are no traces, they don't appear in photos, field notebooks, or travel diaries. There's no writing about them; they aren't in the acknowledgments of books or articles... However, for those of us who can read between the lines, there are silences or gaps in the narrative that reveal that there, precisely there, were people. More people. Different people. </p>
<p>
Invisible people. Or invisibilized (because why and for what reason would anyone talk about them?) </p>
<p><i>
[And here words like "colonialism" or expressions like "hegemonic discourse," "dominant narrative," or "official history" come to my mind, to my mouth, and to the tips of my fingers typing this text. But my mood today asks me to leave them unwritten. Perhaps another day I will bring them up...]</i></p>
<p>
I have had many encounters with these kinds of invisibilized characters; after all, I have spent two decades and a half in these endeavors. One of the cases that caught my attention was during my work in the Galápagos Islands. While reviewing old papers, I found the story of the discovery of a certain zoological species (which I prefer not to mention) on a particular island (whose name I will also withhold). The scientist (whose identity, paraphrasing Miguel de Cervantes, "I prefer not to remember") who found it published his discovery with all the fanfare he could muster. </p>
<p>
But... how did that scientist, a foreigner with poor explorer skills, reach that remote piece of land? How did he traverse its rugged volcanic slopes? </p>
<p>
The Galápagos oral tradition (the living and critical voice of those without written and recognized voice) preserves the names of the sailor who led the "discoverer" to the island and the local guides who accompanied him on the journey. Without them, the discovery would not have been possible. </p>
<p><i>
[Some gossip suggests that it was the guides themselves who made the discovery...]</i></p>
<p>
It goes without saying that those people are not mentioned in any printed text. </p>
<p>
That's how I learned that behind every fragment of "official" history, there are a thousand and one small "unofficial" stories that provide context, nuance the dominant narrative, enrich the scene — and sometimes radically change the narrative. Those "other" stories, starring "other" people, generally go unrecorded. They are preserved and transmitted through orality, the spoken word: a medium generally dismissed for being unreliable, subjective, unstable. And also rebellious, critical, nonconformist, and utterly unwilling to swallow nonsense. </p>
<p>
At other times, such stories can be found when one, like a detective in old nineteenth-century novels, starts to pay attention to seemingly irrelevant details: the presence (or absence — the silences are very telling) of certain words, the gesture in the inner corner of a small, worn-out photo, the note in the margin that fades away... </p>
<p>
This happened to me a couple of weeks ago while working with the early reports from the Barro Colorado biological station (specifically, the one from 1925) when I found an apparently irrelevant name. </p>
<p>
"The past year [1924] has been so eventful that it is by no means easy to deal with all the details of construction and maintenance. The location of the buildings has made this work unusually difficult. Sincere thanks are due to the officials of the Panama Canal for unanimous cooperation and enthusiastic assistance on every possible occasion. Ex-Governor Morrow, Governor Walker, and many others including the Commanding General of the Panama Canal Department and Mr. J. B. Shropshire, Chief Sanitary Inspector, U.S. Army deserve hearty thanks." </p>
<p>
Why was a "Chief Sanitary Inspector" appearing in this list of governors and generals? This detail piqued my curiosity. I began to delve into the annual reports of the Governor of the Canal Zone from the early twentieth century, chasing that surname like a bloodhound. Shropshire appears there, as early as 1919, as "Army sanitary inspector" (Report of the Chief Health Officer. In <i>Annual Report of the Governor of the Panama Canal Zone on the Fiscal Year ended June 30, 1919</i>. Washington: Government Printing Office, 1919, p. 313). </p>
<p>
Thus, I confirmed the identity of the character mentioned in the Barro Colorado report. But... was there nothing more? </p>
<p>
I kept searching and, to my surprise, the surname appeared a few years later in an article in the magazine <i>Zoologica</i> written by Samuel Hildebrand, one of the scientists who participated in the Biological Survey of the Panama Canal conducted by the Smithsonian Institution around 1910. In that text, Hildebrand describes Shropshire as a "malarialogist" (a scholar of malaria, which aligns with his role as sanitary inspector in an area like the Canal at that time), but also as an important collector of biological samples (Hildebrand, Samuel F. The Panama Canal as a Passageway for Fishes, with Lists and Remarks on the Fishes and Invertebrates Observed. <i>Zoologica</i>, 24 (1), 1939, pp. 15-45). </p>
<p>
As a malariologist, he captured and collected mosquitoes, and apparently provided access to his collections to many visiting scientists. This is reflected in texts by Harrison Dyar and Graham Bell Fairchild (Dyar, H. G. & Shannon, R. C. A new sabethid mosquito from Panama. <i>Journal of the Washington Academy of Sciences</i>, 15 (11), June 4, 1925, p. 234; Fairchild, G. B. Notes on Tabanidae from Panama. IX. The genera <i>Stenotabatus</i>... <i>Annals of the Entomological Society of America</i>, 35, 1942, pp. 289-309; Arnett, R. H. Notes on the Distribution, Habits, and Habitats of Some Panama Mosquitoes (Diptera, Culicidæ). <i>Journal of the New York Entomological Society</i>, 55 (3), Sep. 1947, pp. 185-200). </p>
<p>
Once involved in the adventure, I kept digging. Someone with such an interest in natural history could not have limited himself to just mosquitoes in such a lush and vibrant environment. Surely his curiosity would have led him further. And I was right in my assumption. The fish <i>Gobiomorus dormitor</i> was recognized thanks to a specimen he himself captured, and the snake <i>Phrynonax shropshirei</i> bears his surname in the scientific binomial because he found a specimen near Gatun in 1924. </p>
<p>
All those articles, all those new species for science, all that knowledge that has shaped the narrative and development of the history of science in Panama and the tropics, would not have been possible without that person who dedicated his time to traversing the forests and rivers in the Canal Zone, observing, capturing, and preserving specimens. A person who selflessly opened the doors of his collection so that other scientists could describe and publish those species, thus advancing knowledge towards new horizons. A person who spent his free time muddy, wet, and hot (and, surely, bitten by those same mosquitoes he must have come to know so well), in many corners of a Panama rich in life waiting to be discovered and understood. </p>
<p>
There are hundreds, thousands of stories like this, hidden in manuscripts and archival notebooks, in the labels that identify our biological collections, in the photos and notes that we still have the luck to preserve. In this case, there was a clear mention of a specific name. But this doesn't always happen. It's not always so easy, so evident. Which makes the detective work much more exciting. Who was s/he, where was s/he, what did s/he do...? What happened, how did it all end, what remained? </p>
<p>
I invite you to look at what you do from this perspective. You will see that, one way or another, the panorama expands, the image becomes much more diverse and dense, the threads that form the fabric multiply as if by magic. </p>
<p>
And I also invite you to remember that, many times, the papers, objects, and materials we consider "trash" —disposable elements that have already fulfilled their purpose or that, due to the effects of time, seem to have nothing to say— are essential items for telling a story. A complete story, with its many facets and many angles, sometimes sharp, always interesting. </p>
<p>
In entry #4 of this series, I spoke of "the people behind the things." The intention of this text is to ask myself (and you to ask yourselves) what people are behind what things. And which ones don't appear, even though we know —or intuit— that they have been there. Which ones were left out of the picture, backstage, or behind the curtain? </p>
<p>
And, above all: why? </p>
<p>
P.S. After writing this entry, I continued researching J. B. Shropshire. And, in the most unexpected way imaginable, among the documents digitized by the National Library of Panama, I found a true treasure. Here it is, to complete my account. </p>
<p>
"J. B. Shropshire: He was born in Paris, Kentucky, U.S., and obtained a Master of Arts degree, specializing in English Literature at Princeton University. He arrived in the former Canal Zone as a nurse, to escape unfortunate romantic entanglements! The eminent American pathologist, Samuel T. Darling, discoverer of the etiological agent of histoplasmosis, took Shropshire and Dunn, who was also a nurse by profession, under his protective wing and trained them in the rudiments of medical entomology, as he believed that the newly created Canal Zone should have this type of personnel, essential for health work in the tropics. Shropshire was a talented man, whose worth was generally unrecognized due to his shyness. For a time in his life, he was simultaneously a champion in tennis and chess, as well as the main promoter of music festivals in the former Zone. Initially, he worked for the Panama Canal Company but later became the Chief of Malaria Control at the United States Army facilities in the former Canal Zone. Shropshire was very beloved by the Caribbean community, who made up the bulk of the labor force in the Canal Zone; and the health inspectors, mosquito catchers, and ditch diggers who worked under his direction would do anything for him. He planned and directed the construction of many miles of concrete-lined ditches around the Army facilities, and due to his familiarity with the forests and swamps, he came to know Panamanian wildlife intimately. American zoologists visiting the Isthmus could almost always count on Shropshire's help to obtain the most diverse variety of animals. He collected many of the mosquitoes from Panama that were included in the work of the famous author of "The Mosquitoes of the Americas," II. G. Dyar, who named a subgenus of culicids in his honor. He also created an entomological surveillance group to protect the Army facilities against malaria infections. Shropshire never married and lived in humble bachelor quarters surrounded by his water lilies and by the affection and admiration of his Caribbean subordinates, mainly of French descent. He spent his salary on trips to New York City during his vacations to attend performances at the Metropolitan Opera and to support the education of a large number of nephews. Shropshire never claimed to be an entomologist and was rather a self-taught individual in the field of Sanitary Engineering" (pp. 39-40). </p>

I know that they can burn books, raze libraries, ban languages, banish beliefs, erase pasts, erase presents, order futures, torture and execute people. But I also know that they have not yet discovered how to kill the intangible and luminous body of an idea, a dream, or a hope (E. Civallero.
