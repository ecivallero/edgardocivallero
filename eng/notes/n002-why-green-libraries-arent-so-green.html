This note is part of a series that challenges the status quo of "green libraries," exposing greenwashing and tokenism, and exploring viable alternatives, such as minimalism, degrowth, upcycling, and "slow libraries."

<h3>
Introduction</h3>
<p>
"Green libraries" have become the darling of the cultural sector — a shining symbol of environmental consciousness. These spaces for knowledge and memory, clad in glass, steel, and the rhetoric of sustainability, are sold as paragons of ecological progress. Throw in a cloud-based collection, and you've got a library that's not just "modern" but supposedly saving the planet, too.</p>
<p>
Except it's not.</p>
<p>
Behind the polished façades and glowing press releases lies a bitter truth: these so-called "green libraries" are complicit in the very systems that drive ecological collapse. Their glass and steel exteriors guzzle energy, while their digital infrastructures burn through resources in a data-hungry world.</p>
<p>
Yet they continue to parade as eco-heroes, celebrated for aesthetic gestures that barely scratch the surface of real sustainability.</p>
<p>
It's time to strip away the façade and ask some uncomfortable questions. Are "green libraries" truly "green," or are they just greenwashing dressed up in architectural ambition and tech savviness?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>
The Hidden Costs of Green Architecture</h3>
<p>
The architectural designs of "green libraries" are steeped in contradictions. Glass, steel, and concrete dominate their construction — materials that are anything but eco-friendly. Glass is a prime offender, requiring enormous energy to produce, emitting CO₂ at every step of its life cycle, and providing poor insulation that drives up energy demands for heating and cooling.</p>
<p>
The façade of sustainability that many "green libraries" project is often a classic case of greenwashing. Architectural designs marketed as eco-friendly frequently overlook the true environmental costs associated with materials like glass. These materials may be aesthetically pleasing and energy-efficient in the short term, but they come with hidden environmental costs —pollution and resource extraction— that challenge the integrity of the "green" label.</p>
<p>
Steel is no better, requiring extractive mining and smelting processes that are among the most carbon-intensive industries on Earth. Even concrete, the material we take for granted in construction, accounts for roughly 8% of global carbon emissions. These are not minor oversights — they're systemic flaws embedded in the DNA of these so-called "green" buildings.</p>
<p>
And yet, libraries plaster their walls with LEED certifications and "eco-friendly" plaques, selling us the narrative that these materials somehow align with sustainability.</p>
<p>
Rather than focusing on surface-level eco-architecture, libraries could advocate for a shift toward sustainability models that go beyond the visual appeal of green roofs and solar panels. Libraries need to embrace principles such as degrowth and minimalism, reducing their overall ecological footprint by minimizing resource consumption and focusing on truly regenerative design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>
The Digital Mirage</h3>
<p>
If the "green" architecture movement has a twin illusion, it's the promise of digital salvation. As libraries digitize their collections and move services to the cloud, they tout a vision of paperless efficiency and environmental responsibility.</p>
<p>
But digital is not dematerialized. Data centers —the backbone of this transition— consume more electricity than many countries, guzzling power to keep servers running and cool. The energy often comes from fossil fuels, not the green utopia we imagine. The shift to the cloud simply relocates pollution from the visible to the hidden, making it easier for libraries to ignore their growing ecological footprint.</p>
<p>
While libraries have embraced cloud storage as a convenient and efficient alternative to physical spaces, it's essential to confront the environmental cost of these virtual systems. Some research highlights the energy consumption of global data centers, which power the cloud-based services libraries increasingly rely on. These centers significantly contribute to greenhouse gas emissions — reinforcing the idea that so-called 'virtual' libraries are anything but green.</p>
<p>
Add to that the staggering waste generated by hardware production: servers, cables, and other electronic components require rare earth minerals, mined at great cost to ecosystems and human lives. And when they're obsolete, they join the mountains of e-waste poisoning the planet.</p>
<p>
There's growing criticism of the broader economic philosophy driving many sustainability efforts, highlighting the fallacy of "green growth." This model, which underpins many "green libraries," suggests that growth and environmentalism can coexist, but the reality is that growth itself —whether physical or digital— requires an ever-increasing demand for resources, pushing us further into ecological debt. Libraries must challenge this assumption and redefine their role in a world that needs less consumption, not more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>
Let's Bring Down the Facade</h3>
<p>
The narrative of "green libraries" is a convenient lie, offering institutions a way to look good without doing good. Real sustainability is messy, hard, and unglamorous. It doesn't come with shiny buildings or sleek digital platforms. It comes with a willingness to question the systems we rely on, to rethink growth and consumption, and to admit that a library doesn't need a steel-and-glass monument to knowledge or a cloud-based collection to be relevant.</p>
<p>
Libraries can —and should— be leaders in sustainability, but that requires tearing down the illusions of greenwashing and starting from scratch. It means embracing truly regenerative practices, rethinking what a library needs to be, and recognizing that the future isn't in appearances but in substance.</p>
<p>
So, let's stop pretending. Let's get real. And let's redefine what a sustainable library looks like.</p>
