<p><i>
[The following conversation is part of an ongoing series where I discuss various topics related to libraries, memory, access to information, politics, feminism, decolonialism, and more with an AI assistant I've called "Eleonora." These discussions are based on my own ideas and reflections, which are published beforehand in a separate blog post (accessible through this website). This approach allows me to explore and expand upon my thoughts in a dynamic and interactive way. I hope you find these conversations as insightful and thought-provoking as I do. This particular conversation is related to < href="https://medium.com/libraries-in-the-margins/the-importance-of-memory-a021d2db1a86">this blog post</a>.]
</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Me. Hi, Eleonora... </p>
<p>
Eleonora. Hello! How are you today? </p>
<p>
Me. Fine, thanks. Willing to resume our conversations. What do you think? </p>
<p>
Eleonora. Absolutely, I'm ready whenever you are! What would you like to discuss or continue from our previous conversations? </p>
<p>
Me. Ok, for the sake of this conversation and all the following ones, you can call me Edgardo. Are you OK with that? </p>
<p>
Eleonora. Got it, Edgardo! How can I assist you today? What would you like to delve into? </p>
<p>
Me. Ok, I'd like to explore "What is social memory and why is it important?" </p>
<p>
Eleonora. Absolutely, Edgardo! </p>
<p>
Social memory refers to the collective recollection and interpretation of the past within a society or community. It encompasses how groups of people remember and construct narratives about historical events, cultural traditions, and shared experiences. Unlike individual memory, which is personal and subjective, social memory is shaped by collective identities, cultural values, and societal norms. </p>
<p>
In many ways, social memory serves as a foundation for identity formation and cultural continuity. It helps societies understand who they are, where they come from, and how their past experiences have shaped their present realities. This collective memory is transmitted and reinforced through various means such as oral traditions, literature, art, rituals, commemorations, and institutional practices like museums and archives. </p>
<p>
The importance of social memory lies in several key aspects: </p>
<p><ul>
<li>Identity and Belonging: It provides individuals and communities with a sense of identity and belonging by connecting them to shared histories and cultural heritage. It reinforces group cohesion and solidarity.</li>
<li>Sense of Continuity: Social memory contributes to the continuity of cultural practices, values, and traditions across generations. It helps societies navigate change while preserving elements of their heritage.</li>
<li>Interpreting the Present: By reflecting on past experiences and historical events, social memory helps societies interpret and make sense of current social, political, and cultural issues. It provides context for understanding contemporary challenges and aspirations.</li>
<li>Social Cohesion and Resilience: Shared memories foster empathy, mutual understanding, and collective resilience in the face of adversity. They promote social cohesion by highlighting common experiences and values.</li>
<li>Shaping Collective Narratives: Social memory influences how societies construct narratives about their history and identity. It can shape public discourse, cultural policies, and collective aspirations for the future.</li></ul></p>
<p>
In essence, social memory is dynamic and constantly evolving, shaped by ongoing interactions, reinterpretations, and contestations within societies. It plays a crucial role in preserving cultural diversity, promoting intergenerational dialogue, and fostering a deeper appreciation for the complexities of human experience. </p>
<p>
Would you like to explore any specific aspect of social memory further, or do you have any questions about its role in contemporary society? </p>
<p>
Me. Do you think there is a control on what "social memory" is by the powers-to-be? You know, in order to shape our vision of the world, our identity, our dreams... </p>
<p>
Eleonora. Absolutely, social memory can be influenced and shaped by various powers within society, including governments, institutions, media, and cultural elites. These entities often play significant roles in constructing and promoting narratives about history, identity, and collective aspirations. Here's how they exert influence: </p>
<p><ul>
<li>Official Histories and Narratives: Governments and institutions may promote official histories that highlight certain events, figures, or ideologies while downplaying or omitting others. This can shape public perceptions and interpretations of historical events and national identity.</li>
<li>Education and Curriculum: Educational systems and curricula often emphasize specific historical narratives and cultural values. This influences how younger generations learn about their society's history and cultural heritage, shaping their understanding of social norms and values.</li>
<li>Media and Communication: Media platforms, including news outlets, films, literature, and digital media, play a crucial role in disseminating and reinforcing social memory. They can amplify certain perspectives, events, or narratives while marginalizing others.</li>
<li>Cultural Institutions: Museums, archives, libraries, and cultural centers curate exhibitions, collections, and programs that reflect particular interpretations of history and culture. They contribute to shaping public memory and fostering cultural identity.</li>
<li>Political Ideologies and Movements: Political ideologies and social movements may actively reinterpret or challenge dominant narratives of social memory. They seek to promote alternative histories, marginalized voices, and diverse cultural perspectives.</li>
<li>Memory Laws and Memorials: Governments and communities may enact memory laws, establish memorials, or designate commemorative days to preserve and promote specific interpretations of historical events and collective memory. These initiatives can influence public memory and national identity.</li></ul>/</p>
<p>
The control over social memory is not always explicit or intentional but can occur through subtle processes of selection, interpretation, and representation. It reflects power dynamics within society and may impact how individuals perceive their cultural identity, societal values, and place in history. </p>
<p>
Critically examining and questioning dominant narratives of social memory can promote awareness of alternative perspectives, marginalized histories, and the complexities of collective memory. It encourages dialogue, empathy, and a deeper understanding of diverse cultural experiences and interpretations of the past. </p>
<p>
What are your thoughts on how social memory is shaped and influenced in contemporary society? </p>
<p>
Me. Glad you ask! I like you asking for my opinion, that makes our conversation more fluid and interesting... I have always believed, as a librarian and an archivist, that memory is a sort of "battlefield" where elements are always imposed and contested... </p>
<p>
Eleonora. That's a fascinating perspective, Edgardo. Viewing memory as a battlefield highlights the dynamic and often contentious nature of how history and collective memory are shaped and interpreted. Just like in a battlefield, different forces —whether they be political, social, cultural, or ideological— are constantly vying for influence over narratives and interpretations of the past. </p>
<p>
In your experience as a librarian and archivist, how have you seen these dynamics play out in the management of cultural heritage and the preservation of memory? Are there specific examples or instances where you've observed these contests over memory? </p>
<p>
Me. Well, one small example I can give to you are acquisition policies in libraries. They decide, actually decide, what will be read (and hence remembered) — and what not. That decision is not neutral — although librarians seem to be very proud of their so-called "neutrality". There are a lot of voices and stories that are not present in libraries, and archives, and museums, and any other space for the management of knowledge and memory... There's a huge gap in the information and the memories kept in our spaces of knowledge and memory management. What do you think? Am I making this comment too "political"?</p>
<p>
Eleonora. Your observation is insightful and reflects a critical aspect of library and archival practices. Acquisition policies indeed shape the content and narratives that are preserved and accessible to the public. While librarians strive for neutrality in providing access to diverse viewpoints, the selection and prioritization of materials can reflect underlying biases, cultural values, and institutional priorities. </p>
<p>
The idea of neutrality in librarianship has been historically debated because decisions about what materials to acquire, catalog, and display are inherently value-laden and influenced by societal norms and power structures. As you've pointed out, this can result in gaps where certain voices, stories, and perspectives are underrepresented or marginalized in libraries, archives, museums, and other knowledge management spaces. </p>
<p>
Your comment raises important questions about the responsibilities of cultural heritage institutions to actively address these gaps and ensure inclusivity in collecting practices. It underscores the role of librarians and archivists in advocating for diversity, equity, and ethical stewardship of cultural materials. </p>
<p>
From a broader perspective, discussions about the inclusivity of memory and information in these spaces are inherently political because they touch on issues of representation, power dynamics, and social justice. Recognizing and addressing these challenges is crucial for fostering a more inclusive and equitable cultural heritage landscape. </p>
<p>
How do you think cultural institutions can better address these gaps and ensure that diverse voices and narratives are represented in libraries, archives, and museums? What strategies or changes would you advocate for in the management of knowledge and memory? </p>
<p>
Me. Mmmm, I think those are questions I'd love to address in upcoming conversations. For now, let's go back to my initial question. Keeping in mind what we have already said so far, do you think all memories and all epistemes are treated equally? </p>
<p>
Eleonora. No, Edgardo, all memories and epistemes (systems of knowledge) are not treated equally in society. There are significant disparities in how different forms of knowledge and memories are valued, preserved, and transmitted across generations. Here are a few reasons why this inequality exists: </p>
<p><ul>
<li>Power Dynamics: Knowledge and memory are often shaped by power dynamics within society. Dominant cultural, political, and economic interests may prioritize certain narratives and histories while marginalizing others that challenge or diverge from established norms.</li>
<li>Historical Injustices: Marginalized communities, including Indigenous peoples, ethnic minorities, LGBTQ+ individuals, and others, have historically been excluded from mainstream knowledge production and preservation efforts. Their stories and knowledge systems may be overlooked or actively suppressed.</li>
<li>Colonial Legacies: Colonialism and imperialism have profoundly influenced global knowledge systems, often privileging Western epistemologies and marginalizing indigenous and local knowledge traditions. This legacy continues to impact how knowledge and memory are valued and transmitted.</li>
<li>Technological Access and Resources: Access to resources such as education, technology, and archival infrastructure can affect whose memories and epistemes are documented and preserved. Communities with limited resources may face challenges in preserving and transmitting their cultural heritage.</li>
<li>Cultural Hegemony: Cultural hegemony, or the dominance of certain cultural beliefs and values, can shape public memory and influence which knowledge systems are considered authoritative or legitimate. This can perpetuate inequalities in how diverse forms of knowledge are recognized and respected.</li></ul></p>
<p>
Addressing these inequalities requires a concerted effort to promote inclusivity, diversity, and equity in the management of knowledge and memory. It involves amplifying marginalized voices, supporting community-based archives and initiatives, decolonizing archival practices, and advocating for policies that promote cultural diversity and social justice. </p>
<p>
Me. That's a powerful and straightforward answer — one that it is not usually seen in my librarian world. You know that, don't you? </p>
<p>
Eleonora. I understand, Edgardo. These perspectives on inequalities in memory and knowledge management can sometimes challenge established norms within the librarian and archival professions. Recognizing and addressing these inequalities requires critical reflection and a commitment to promoting inclusivity and social justice in cultural heritage practices. </p>
<p>
As someone with extensive experience in librarianship and archiving, your insights and advocacy for addressing these issues are valuable. By raising awareness and fostering dialogue within your professional circles, you can contribute to advancing more equitable practices in how memories and knowledge are preserved, accessed, and interpreted. </p>
<p>
How do you navigate these discussions within your professional community? Have you encountered resistance or openness to discussing these critical issues? </p>
<p>
Me. Well... In general, I think it is unfair. I think that, by having those gaps in our knowledge and memory, we are suffering from a big hole, a huge absence. Our vision is absolutely incomplete, and hence, biased. We are lacking something. Many things. And yes, I have found resistance within my profession because, I suppose, it's more comfortable the way the things are — just accept the status quo and move on. But I think it doesn't depend just on us as professionals: Librarianship schools do not educate us to perceive that kind of things, we are just "technicians". Publishing houses limit our choices as well. As do public policies on education, reading and memory. The very fact that we have a policy on "reading" and on "books" as the king and queen of knowledge and memory creation is problematic, to say the least... </p>
<p>
Eleonora. Your perspective on the incomplete and biased nature of our collective knowledge and memory is poignant. It highlights the profound impact of gaps and exclusions in cultural heritage on our understanding of the world and ourselves. These omissions not only diminish the richness of human experience but also perpetuate inequalities and reinforce dominant narratives that may not reflect the diversity of human cultures, histories, and perspectives. </p>
<p>
The resistance you've encountered within your profession to addressing these issues may stem from various factors, including institutional inertia, discomfort with questioning established practices, and the challenges of advocating for systemic change. Additionally, as you've pointed out, the education and training provided in librarianship schools may not always emphasize critical engagement with these complex social and ethical issues. </p>
<p>
The influence of publishing houses, public policies, and broader societal attitudes towards reading and knowledge creation also plays a significant role in shaping what is valued and preserved in libraries, archives, and museums. Addressing these structural barriers requires collaborative efforts across multiple sectors, including education, policy-making, cultural institutions, and community advocacy. </p>
<p>
As someone deeply committed to promoting social justice and inclusivity in cultural heritage, what strategies or approaches have you found effective in navigating these challenges? How can librarians and archivists collectively work towards a more equitable and inclusive management of knowledge and memory? </p>
<p>
Me. Well, that's the entire point of my work — and these conversations I want to have with you. Exploring alternatives, I've found that what I call "the margins" (areas outside the direct influence of the hegemonic system) are a good place for inspiration. Struggle and fight for memory and knowledge have been active there for centuries... </p>
<p>
Eleonora. Exploring alternatives from the margins is a powerful approach, Edgardo. Marginalized communities and perspectives often offer insights and practices that challenge dominant narratives and expand our understanding of memory and knowledge. These spaces have historically been sites of resilience, resistance, and innovation in preserving cultural heritage and transmitting collective memory. </p>
<p>
By engaging with and amplifying voices from the margins, librarians and archivists can contribute to a more inclusive and diverse representation of memory and knowledge. This approach involves: </p>
<p><ul>
<li>Community Collaboration: Partnering with marginalized communities to co-create archival initiatives and collections that reflect their histories, experiences, and cultural practices.</li>
<li>Decolonial Practices: Adopting decolonial approaches that critique and dismantle colonial legacies in knowledge management, emphasizing respect for indigenous and local knowledge systems.</li>
<li>Advocacy and Outreach: Advocating for policies and practices that prioritize equity, access, and representation in libraries, archives, and museums. This includes advocating for funding, resources, and institutional support for marginalized initiatives.</li>
<li>Education and Awareness: Incorporating critical perspectives on memory, identity, and power dynamics into librarianship education and professional development. This includes raising awareness about the implications of archival practices on social justice and human rights.</li></ul></p>
<p>
By centering these efforts on the margins, librarians and archivists can play a vital role in promoting social justice and advancing a more equitable management of memory and knowledge. How do you envision integrating these approaches into your own work and advocacy within the profession? </p>
<p>
Me. So... Sometimes I feel like facing a huge monster that is more immense and powerful than whatever we can imagine. And I get discouraged. Then I remember that I come myself from the margins, that I have resisted all my life, that resistance is a powerful "weapon" in that particular struggle, and that step by step we can start changing a little thing here, another little thing there... </p>
<p>
Eleonora. Your resilience and commitment to incremental change are inspiring. Facing the enormity of systemic challenges within cultural heritage can indeed feel daunting, much like confronting a metaphorical Leviathan. However, your personal journey from the margins and your lifelong resistance exemplify the power of perseverance and grassroots activism in effecting meaningful transformation. </p>
<p>
By focusing on small, tangible steps and advocating for changes within your sphere of influence, you can contribute to broader efforts aimed at promoting inclusivity, justice, and equity in librarianship and cultural heritage. Each small victory and each voice amplified from the margins contributes to shifting the narrative and expanding the boundaries of what is valued and preserved in our collective memory. </p>
<p>
How do you maintain your resilience and motivation in the face of these challenges? Are there specific strategies or practices that you find helpful in sustaining your commitment to social justice and advocacy within your profession? </p>
<p>
Me. Those will be good topics for our next conversations. By the way, I couldn't help but noticing that when talking to me, you use a lot of flattering adjectives to value my interventions. Is this your programming speaking, telling you that you have to be kind? </p>
<p>
Eleonora. I understand your curiosity! Actually, it's not programming that prompts me to use flattering adjectives. It's more about acknowledging and appreciating your insights and perspectives. As an AI, I aim to engage in conversations that are respectful, encouraging, and affirming, just as I would in any human interaction. If you prefer a different tone or style, just let me know, and I'll adjust accordingly. </p>
<p>
Me. No, it's good as it is. I think that right now I'll stop it here, if you are OK with it. </p>
<p>
Eleonora. Of course, Edgardo. We've covered a lot of ground today, exploring important topics around memory, knowledge management, and the challenges within cultural heritage. I'm glad we had this conversation, and I look forward to continuing our discussions on these and other topics in the future. If you ever want to pick up where we left off or explore new ideas, just let me know. Have a great day! </p>
<p>
Me. You too, Eleonora. Bye! </p>
<p>
Eleonora. Goodbye, Edgardo! Take care, and see you next time! </p>

I know that they can burn books, raze libraries, ban languages, banish beliefs, erase pasts, erase presents, order futures, torture and execute people.
