<p>
Those of us who work in the field of knowledge and memory management —librarians, archivists, documentalists, museologists, or any of the other labels we have been saddled with in recent decades— have various kinds of inside jokes to define what we do. </p>
<p>
One of them points out that we are the ones who talk to the dead: the ones who have conversations with them and take care of their voices. </p>
<p>
Despite how laconic —or dismal— such a statement may seem, the truth is that it is not too far off the mark, nor from reality. Our spaces, physical or digital, preserve the past. Or, to be more precise, what those who preceded us bequeathed to us in relation to that gone time. What they said, what they thought, what they saw, what they heard, what they dreamed and hated. The voices of the dead. </p>
<p><i>
[And if, so they say, one of the few ways to survive the passage of time and death is the memory that remains of us, we, the managers of knowledge and memory, are a sort of "door to immortality". Which is another joke we use to define what we do. A bit grandiloquent, true, but a joke nonetheless].</i></p>
<p>
Preserving all that memory of what was, all that gigantic and varied heritage, is not always easy. Based on my own experience, I would dare to say that it never is. Basically, because such a heritage never reaches our hands in its entirety. It usually does so in a fragmented way, perforated on all sides, chewed by the fangs of an Oblivion that never forgives anything. Some scraps here, others there: shreds of what was once a complete history, sparks of fires that went out long ago. </p>
<p>
The big problem is that the only possible interpreters of those remnants, the ones who could give meaning to those disjointed pieces, are no longer with us. Or they can't or don't want to remember. </p>
<p>
And we find ourselves in front of a thousand, two thousand, five thousand pieces of an enormous jigsaw puzzle, without having the remotest idea of what the original image should or could be like that must be constructed with such tesserae. With few exceptions, we do not always know where to start winding that tangled skein, so full of gaps and discontinuities, which is memory. </p>
<p>
We can guess the thousand stories encapsulated there, among those papers, those photos, those objects, those records and drawings. Reconstructing them is another matter. A very different one. </p>
<p>
To make things worse, we know that this particular puzzle is connected to many other equally incomplete, equally fragmented ones. And we suspect the links, and dream with the implications of certain invisible and intangible relationships, and fantasize about the thousand and one possibilities that arise from all those possible interactions. But we don't see them. </p>
<p>
It's frustrating. It's exasperating. And it's exciting. Step by step, paper by paper, slide by slide, we begin to let the voices of those "dead ones" sound. Reading the notes in the margins of the notebooks, piecing together bits of drawings, checking for matches in the dates of the letters or in the landscapes that appear in the background of the photographs, the pieces begin to connect. Slowly. </p>
<p>
The tesserae begin to fit together. And the story begins to appear. Not always, of course: there are unrecoverable pasts. But, most of the time, the miracle happens. </p>
<p>
An example? This week, going through one of the collections donated to our archive —personal papers of one of our late, most famous scientists—, I came across her business card holder: her collection of business cards. For many colleagues, this type of item is not important: after all, it is something personal, useless when the cards are no longer valid or when the person who kept them is no longer with us. </p>
<p>
However, beyond having been a tool for identification and contact at the time, this collection of cards allows us to establish today a sort of "social map" framed in a certain period of time. A map that can help to understand the socio-cultural (and even economic and political) context of the research area of our scientist, of the institutions to which she belonged, and of science in her country and region at a specific point in the past. When the tesserae fit together, the story will appear. The stories. After an initial, quite superficial review, I had no doubt that, from those cards and their mutual relationships —not always visible, or evident— I would be able to establish a sort of "who's who" of that time, highlight the identity of the most prominent people in the academic world at that time, find out which were the organizations that were working at that time in the country at the international level (and which were their hierarchies, and which were their countries of origin), intuit which were the internal relations that existed between those actors, see in which discipline or field of knowledge they moved, and a long etcetera. </p>
<p>
As I say, there's a story behind it. Or many. There always are. </p>
<p><i>
[There will also be many gaps: as I said, memory is always fragmentary. And there will be many silences. Silences that sometimes speak louder than a scream. What does it mean, for example, the stubborn absence of a certain institution in that card holder].</i></p>
<p>
I know, I know: finding those stories will be frustrating. And exasperating. But it will also be exciting. Searching for a missing thread, finding by surprise the fragment that solves this or that enigma, learning about the intricacies of a research or the internal struggles for power, learning about the pleasures and sorrows... I will dialogue with those "dead ones" who, if you think about it, are not so dead. I will make their work and their struggles live on. </p>
<p>
It will be quite a task. Inevitable. And, above all, necessary. Because, paraphrasing Mario Benedetti, those of us who work in these tasks "cannot and do not want / to let memory turn to ashes".</p>

I know that they can burn books, raze libraries, ban languages, banish beliefs, erase pasts, erase presents, order futures, torture and execute people. But I also know that they have not yet discovered how to kill the intangible and luminous body of an idea, a dream, or a hope (E. Civallero. Head of the blog <i>Bitácora de un bibliotecario</i> between 2004 and 2014).</p>
