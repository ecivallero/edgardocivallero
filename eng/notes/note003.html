<p class="title">Going beyond ORCID: Identifying ourselves in the academic world</p>
<p class="subtitle">Note #003</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Ok: having a unique identification number (ORCID) in a digital world where hundreds of thousands of academics coexist and compete is very useful. That's what I've reviewed in the previous two posts in this series (#1 and #2). Besides providing other well interesting services, ORCID's main function is to uniquely identify a person and link them to their work, their scholarly output. </p>
<p>
But we all know that we are more than a number and a list of articles. Or, at this point in the history of the Internet, we should know that. </p>
<p>
Today we have to show what we do. Build what marketing experts call "a personal brand." </p>
<p>
To do so, it is not necessary to share our intimacies, nor to post a dozen times a day on all available platforms, nor to exhibit ourselves desperately (and, sometimes, a bit impudently) in front of strangers in search of gaining a "like", a follower, a comment, or a reply. However, in a world where visibility has become essential to establish a good network of contacts and supporters, and where, sometimes, social networks are analyzed when it comes to providing employment or funding, it is worth considering the careful creation of this virtual identity. </p>
<p>
What do we do, why do we do it, what for, why is it important, what doors and windows does it open, what problems does it close? </p>
<p>
Science is a process of collective knowledge construction, which requires dialogue, debate, discussion... And if it has direct applications in social and environmental change, so much the better. Telling all this, sharing it, showing it, explaining it, can result in a greater visibility and understanding of academic work and its importance in our current societies. </p>
<p>
In the following posts I will be sharing some elements that can be useful for this goal of identifying ourselves, of "showing ourselves", of creating that "personal brand" as important as it is questionable, and of sharing what we do, and why, and what for. </p>
<p>
Among other things, we will see how and why to maintain a blog in which we can disseminate what we do in a tone that is not as academic as the articles we publish; how to find other media and platforms to tell stories, such as photographs, podcasts or video; how to stop talking about our processes and share a bit of our contexts; how to participate in collaborative networks where we can share our ideas and experiences and, at the same time, accompany citizen science movements; how to prepare informative and educational content that can serve as real workshops and virtual classes; and how, in short, to position ourselves and create an authentic network of vibrant, lively, active and dynamic contacts. </p>
<p>
Now then: the big question, before starting this journey, is one that may seem very philosophical, but is essential: Who are we? </p>
<p><i>
[And I say this because most of the time what is shown outwardly in this type of networks and public and visible spaces is nothing more than an avatar: a simplified and stylized image. The version of us that we want the audience to see].</i></p>
<p>
We are not always a profession, or a position, or results, or a discovery. There is much more to it. However, we don't always want to show it. So, defining who we are and what part of that we want to share is a very important step. </p>
<p>
And that's followed by other questions: what do we do, and why should anyone care? Are we able to explain it in simple language? </p>
<p>
Although perhaps the last question on my list should be the first: do we really want to do all this? </p>
<p>
The answer may very well be "no." For those people who think "yes" will come the next posts in this series. </p>

I know that they can burn books, raze libraries, ban languages, banish beliefs, erase pasts, erase presents, order futures, torture and execute people. But I also know that they have not yet discovered how to kill the intangible and luminous body of an idea, a dream, or a hope (E. Civallero. Head of the blog <i>Bitácora de un bibliotecario</i> between 2004 and 2014).</p>
