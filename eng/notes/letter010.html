<p>
They appeared. Just like that. It often happens this way, and that's one of the charms of this profession that I experience daily and share with you through these letters. </p>
<p>
I'm talking about two documents I found in a corner of my office. No one has been able to explain how they ended up there. As I said, they just appeared. When I unpacked the first one, I found the seal of James Zetek's library on the first page. It sent shivers down my spine. Just like that. </p>
<p><i>
[James Zetek was an American entomologist, and in the second quarter of the 20th century, he was the resident custodian of the Barro Colorado Island (BCI) Biological Station in Lake Gatun: the germ of what is now STRI.]</i></p>
<p>
The page with that seal displayed the title of the document: <i>Reports of the Canal Zone Biological Area, 1925-1940</i>. These were the earliest reports from the BCI biological station. First-hand data: a log of everything that happened during each of those years, with names, budgets, actions, data, and some anecdotes... </p>
<p>
I searched our institutional database. I looked through other international databases, the Biodiversity Heritage Library, Archive.org. I scoured the entire Internet. And found nothing. Nothing at all. No one else seemed to have a copy of these documents. </p>
<p>
I was holding a treasure. Quite unique, indeed. </p>
<p>
What I'm telling you happened months ago. Today, the document is already scanned and transcribed, and little by little, I have been annotating and translating it into Spanish. And in the process, I've discovered smaller treasures within the big treasure. Like a giant Russian <i>matryoshka</i>.</p>
<p><i>
[All are, in fact: just look a little more carefully. Pay attention, as I once told you in another letter, to the small details.]</i></p>
<p>
One of those smaller-treasures-within-the-big-treasure was found a couple of weeks ago. While examining the first report, from 1925, I began to detect, among its paragraphs (specifically in the "Visitors" section), some words and phrases that stood out from the general fabric of the text as if they were loose threads. </p>
<p>
I confess that my impulse, when I find these threads, is to pull on them. </p>
<p><i>
[You are trying to imagine the state of my clothes, right?]</i></p>
<p>
You probably know that this curiosity, the one sparked by small elements that seem to “stand out” from the panoramic picture, is what has fueled many investigations. You might also know, or imagine (and if not, here I am to tell you), that sometimes the thread leads nowhere: it's simply a false lead. Other times, it leads to interesting discoveries: the beginning of a long and rich path of building and developing new knowledge, all motivated by an initial "small detail." </p>
<p>
That being said, the first fragment of text that caught my attention was this: </p>
<p>
"Dr. Harrison G. Dyar, Curator of Mosquitoes, U. S. National Museum, Washington, D. C., worked principally at Ancon, but visited the island with Mr. Shannon. Mrs. Dyar assisted in his studies of mosquitos." </p>
<p>
I must clarify that one of my main interests in bibliographic-historical research is finding the traces left by women. In general, they have been greatly overlooked in scientific literature and academic reports, despite having been involved in many important activities. In this context, and given that Dyar's wife apparently was involved in the work on Barro Colorado, I tried to find out who she was. </p>
<p>
I've been surprised many times when diving into these types of processes. But what I found here, I truly did not expect. </p>
<p>
It turns out that Harrison Dyar (American entomologist, 1866-1929) was bigamous. He was married to Zella Peabody (with whom he had two children) and in a relationship with Wellesca Pollock (with whom he had several children), whom he met (a) while Pollock was a part-time assistant at the Smithsonian Institution, or (b) at Baha'i meetings both frequented (in fact, Pollock adopted the Persian name "Aseyeh," and was one of the earliest adherents of this faith in the U.S.). </p>
<p><i>
[If you don't know what the Baha'i religion is, I invite you to do a little research about it. Wikipedia may help...]</i></p>
<p>
When the topic came to light, it caused a huge scandal in the Washingtonian society of the time. In 1921, Dyar finally “regularized” his situation: he divorced Peabody and married Pollock... </p>
<p>
...who was the one who visited Barro Colorado in 1924 assisting him in his studies of mosquitoes. </p>
<p><i>
[It's not the ending I would have liked to read, I must admit. But well, perhaps it's my vengeful spirit speaking...]</i></p>
<p>
Dyar's story is much more complex and goes beyond this: he quarreled with half the world at the Smithsonian Institution, had quite complicated personal habits, and adored... digging tunnels, a fact discovered when a large truck casually driving down the street sank into one of them. </p>
<p>
If you're interested in this character, check out Marc Epstein's book <i>Moths, Myths, and Mosquitoes: The Eccentric Life of Harrison G. Dyar, Jr.</i> (Oxford: University Press, 2016). You can ask me for it if you wish. </p>
<p>
The second text that caught my attention in the 1925 report from the BCI station (in the same "Visitors" section) was this one: </p>
<p>
"Dr. Reginald Gordon Harris, Director, Biological Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, Long Island, came here for studies of endocrine control of metamorphosis in lepidopterous larvae, which were carried on at Board of Health Laboratory, Ancon; as well as several daily trips to the Island when some lepidoptera were secured. These studies were carried on while waiting for the arrival of Mr. Marsh who had arranged to take Mr. and Mrs. Harris to the San Blas coast to study the 'White Indians.'"</p>
<p>
Harris (1898-1936) was an American biologist, but his true passion was travel and contact with different cultures. At that time, the story of the "white Indians of Darién" was popular. It turns out that, apparently, the Gunadule people were famous at that time (I don't know if they still are, and honestly, I don't know if they ever were) for having one of the highest rates of albinism among Latin American indigenous societies. In 1923-1924, Richard O. Marsh's (tragic, indeed) expedition to Darién described these "white Indians" or "blond Indians" (there's a review by H. L. Fairchild in <i>Science</i>, 60 (1550), pp. 235-237, regarding this trip, which is worth reading — and you can also ask me for it if you wish). </p>
<p>
The fact is that, during his stay in Panama, Harris took the opportunity to visit the San Blas archipelago and later wrote one of the books by which he is best remembered, and which has nothing to do with biology: <i>The Tule Indians of San Blas</i> (Panama: Imprenta Nacional, 1926). </p>
<p>
And finally, the third fragment of text that caught my curiosity was this: </p>
<p>
"Dr. Dorothy L. Popenoe, Student of Grasses, formerly at Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew, England, visited the island to collect grasses." </p>
<p>
“A grass student?” I wondered. I found it curious, so I dug a little. And I discovered that Dorothy Kate Popenoe was an English botanist (a specialist in grasses, indeed), archaeologist, and illustrator. In 1925, her husband, agricultural explorer Wilson Popenoe... </p>
<p><i>
[An agricultural explorer was a botanist who traveled the world seeking new potential agricultural products, and the tropics, as you can imagine, were a fertile ground for such discoveries.]</i></p>
<p>
...accepted a job with the United Fruit Company. At that time, they moved to Honduras, where she conducted a series of interesting academic works, including the study of numerous Maya ruins (Tenampa, Cerro Palenque, Playa de los Muertos...). </p>
<p>
During her work in Playa de los Muertos, she ate an unripe akee. </p>
<p><i>
[The akee (Blighia sapida) is a tropical fruit.]</i></p>
<p>
And it was thanks to her that part of the European world learned that akees must be fully ripe and cooked to be consumed. Because Popenoe died of poisoning in 1932. At the age of 33. </p>
<p>
By something known in the Caribbean for decades as "Jamaican vomit." </p>
<p>
Evidently, none of these stories I've shared here are "great stories." They are rather "circumstantial anecdotes." To say the truth, they are simply "curiosities." But from each of these threads that appear by chance, we can begin to weave a fabric. Start asking questions. Did all those people on the 1924 visitor list meet each other while working on Barro Colorado Island? If they did, what conversations did they have? Did they influence each other, perhaps? </p>
<p>
When pulling one of these threads, usually nothing appears. Or maybe we only find a string of small curiosities. But let's not lose the habit of pulling on each thread we find. Who knows? We might discover the subject of our next research. Or our next book. </p>

[Or our next blog post. Right?]</i></p>

I know that they can burn books, raze libraries, ban languages, banish beliefs, erase pasts, erase presents, order futures, torture and execute people. But I also know that they have not yet discovered how to kill the intangible and luminous body of an idea, a dream, or a hope (E. Civallero. Head of the blog <i>Bitácora de un bibliotecario</i> between 2004 and 2014).</p>
