<p>
I didn't understand the meaning of the old Castilian saying "words and cherries get entangled with each other" until the day I tried to take a couple of cherries out of a huge basket full of them, freshly harvested, back in the Jerte Valley in Extremadura, western Spain. The stems get hooked together and create bunches of cherries. To grab just one is pretty difficult: a whole bunch gets tangled up behind the first one. </p>
<p>
The same thing usually happens with words. That is what the ancient wisdom of the Castilian peasants wanted to capture in the proverb, I guess. </p>
<p>
And, when you think about it, something similar happens with ideas. Or, at least, that is what I have been experiencing lately. </p>
<p>
Let me tell you. I happen to be putting together a "Historical Bibliography" of STRI for "<a href="https://striresearch.si.edu/library/" target="_blank" title="Donde habitan las palabras" alt="Donde habitan las palabras">Donde habitan las palabras</a>", the Library & Archive's digital humanities project / virtual platform. So, I diligently started researching. And, respecting the necessary and convenient chronological order, I began with the documents produced during the renowned Smithsonian Biological Survey of the Panama Canal Zone (1910-1912). </p>
<p><i>
[If you are not familiar with that part of STRI's history, do not worry: I am also preparing a "Chronology" (parallel to the "Bibliography..." mentioned above) where I will collect all those facts].</i></p>
<p>
One of the most complete (and at the same time concise) sources about this project turned out to be an article included in the <i>Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections</i>...</p>
<p><i>
[If you don't know what the SMC are, see "STRI en BHL" in "Donde habitan las palabras". An umpteenth, shameless attempt for self-promotion...? Naaaah: it's called "mar-ke-ting"].</i></p>
<p>
...precisely titled "Smithsonian Biological Survey of the Panama Canal Zone" and included under the heading "Expeditions organized or participated in by the Smithsonian Institution in 1910 and 1911" (SMC, 59 (11), July 1912, pp. 15-26). </p>
<p>
The text describes the participants of the Biological Survey, their tasks, and their travels, and includes a number of rather interesting photos that, at first glance, seemed to me to have been taken by those participants, the Survey scientists. However, one of them —that of a man standing in front of some huge grasses at Mindi in the Canal Zone (p. 25)— caught my eye. "Photograph by Hitchcock," the caption at the bottom read. </p>
<p>
There was no Hitchcock on the list of researchers who worked on the Biological Survey. But that surname rang a bell. A lot. From where? </p>
<p>
At that point my other self, a tiny, intense (and unbearable, but don't tell him I said that) character who rents me a room in some corner of the inside of my head and who has the same damned photographic memory I have, pointed out that we had came across that name in an article by Pamela Henson. </p>
<p>
"Ahaha..." I smiled. Henson had published a text on the Biological Survey in a special issue of the journal <i>Environmental History</i> (21 (2), April 2016, pp. 222-230). The paper had caught my attention because the bibliography included archival resources from the Smithsonian — a rare occurrence. Hitchcock's name appeared a couple of times in that bibliography. </p>
<p>
I pondered the evidence for a while. And I concluded that this Hitchcock guy would have probably been a traveler who had been in the area at the time of the Biological Survey, who had taken a couple of cool photos at the Canal Zone, and who was friends with one or more of the scientists who were working there, thus lending them the images for their publications. </p>
<p>
"Ahaha..." smiled my other self, mimicking me (poorly). If Henson had included that name among the relevant archival resources in relation to the Survey, it would be necessary to check it out. The ideas were beginning to hook together, like cherries, and that, to me, is always good news. Paths that branch —into ten, into a hundred, into a thousand— lead to much more than a single destination or just one point on the horizon. </p>
<p>
It turned out that Albert Spear Hitchcock —so this guy was called— was an American botanist specialized in grasses, and had carried out a scientific expedition through Central America —including Panama, of course— during the same period as the Biological Survey (although without any relation to it, and without many relevant results in relation to the Panamanian flora). He had, however, taken a couple of interesting photos around the Canal. </p>
<p>
Including the one of the tall grasses. </p>
<p><i>
[The fact that Hitchcock was a grass researcher solved an existential doubt that my other self and I had: why did that good man photograph precisely those plants, no matter how tall they were, with an entire exotic jungle of hundreds of unidentified species surrounding him...]?</i></p>
<p>
Looking through the digital archives of the Smithsonian Archives, I discovered that years after that expedition, in 1923-1924, Hitchcock visited Panama again, this time en route to Guayaquil, on a trip in which he planned to study the grasses of the Ecuadorian, Peruvian and Bolivian Andes. During his passage through the Canal Zone —which he described in a quite succinct page-and-a-half of his personal diary, written in practically unintelligible handwriting— he again took a number of interesting photos, including some of Barro Colorado Island (BCI). One of them, showing the tree stumps sticking out of Gatun Lake, stuck with me — probably because it is one of the images that most caught my eye during my first visit to the island.</p>
<p>
More cherries in the bunch. And I kept pulling. </p>
<p>
From in there, my other self prodded me, "Could it be that those pictures of this Hitchcock guy were published somewhere else?" </p>
<p>
He knows me well, the little rascal, and knows I'm not going to sit idly by while I have an unanswered question in front of me. So, I went to my early bibliography list on STRI, Panama and Barro Colorado and, after the <i>Miscellaneous Collections</i> and the <i>Annual Reports</i>, the first book published on the topic was <i>Jungle Island</i>.</p>
<p><i>
[Something you all already know because you have read the entry we have dedicated to that book in the "Tesoros" section of "Donde habitan las palabras", right?]</i></p>
<p><i>
[* Fingers of my right hand rhythmically tapping on the table, tucutucutú-tucutucutú *]</i></p>
<p><i>
[Right??]</i></p>
<p>
<i>Jungle Island</i> was a book produced by Warder C. Allee and Marjorie Hill Allee. Marjorie was an excellent writer, especially in the area of juvenile popular books, and her husband, Warder, was a renowned zoologist. They both traveled to Panama in the winter of 1923 and worked on the “jungle island” of the title: Barro Colorado. And they wrote a very entertaining (and educational) account of their wanderings on Panamanian lands. </p>
<p>
But no, they did not include any photographs of Hitchcock in their pages. They did include images taken by themselves, though, or borrowed from BCI's resident custodian, the ineffable James Zetek, or from German naturalist Otto Lutz, who by that time had already been living in Panama for several years — and whose work in the country deserves a separate narrative. </p>
<p>
One of Lutz's most interesting photos included in that book —the first entirely dedicated to BCI, by the way— shows the famous "Shannon Shack", a somewhat improvised hut that visiting scientists used for a long time for their observations in the middle of the forest. The photo hooked, like a cherry, with a fragment of oral tradition stored in some hidden fold of my memory: a conversation with a naturalist guide on the island who told me that this had been the first construction to be erected there. </p>
<p>
But... What about this Shannon guy...? </p>
<p>
Before I could complete the question, my other self was already tugging at my sleeve insistently, suggesting (suggesting?) that we continue tangling cherries. How could I resist? When you have the end of a ball of yarn at the tip of your finger and the soul of a cat, like the one I have inside, you can't resist the impulse. </p>
<p>
Raymond C. Shannon was an American entomologist who spent the months of June and July 1923 studying mosquitoes and other insects in Barro Colorado. At least that is what he stated in one of his articles (The occurrence of Phlebotomus in Panama. <i>Journal of the Washington Academy of Sciences</i>, 16 (7), 1926, pp. 190-193). And he did not lie: the first <i>Report of the Canal Zone Biological Area</i> —which so far exists only as a mimeograph copy in the STRI archive and was produced by Thomas Barbour in 1925— confirms these facts and adds that he was "the first to live upon the island", the person who "built and occupied" the "Shannon Shack", and the one who "chose the site which was finally decided upon for the buildings" of the scientific station in BCI. </p>
<p>
And there, at that point, I decided to stop. I had had enough: from paper to paper, from cherry to cherry, I had traveled in time from the Biological Survey to the beginnings of the Institute for Research in Tropical America, predecessor of today's STRI. I slipped my other self an imaginary, well-charged linden tea to calm him down, and took a panoramic look at the little historical-memorial fabric I had sketched in a matter of minutes. How many more elements could I add to it? Would only the tasty, ripe cherries come out of the basket, or would the green, the wormy, the rotten, the broken ones come out too? How many bifurcations, ramifications, twists and turns would these paths have? Where would they lead? How many threads would be needed to complete the weaving? What image would such a textile show at the end? </p>
<p>
I had just finished, and I already felt like starting again. And that's one of the interesting things about weaving memories: once you start, you can't stop. </p> 
<p>
Almost the same as when you eat cherries, isn't it? </p>

I know that they can burn books, raze libraries, ban languages, banish beliefs, erase pasts, erase presents, order futures, torture and execute people. But I also know that they have not yet discovered how to kill the intangible and luminous body of an idea, a dream, or a hope (E. Civallero.
