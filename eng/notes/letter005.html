<p>
It happened about six years ago, in a place I can't remember — I have been in this profession of mine for too long, and places, faces, voices and topics start to blur, to mix, and not always in the most subtle way. I had been commissioned to receive, in the library-archive-museum that I was leading at the time, a group of elementary school students. To tell them what we did, why we existed, why they should visit us and use our services... You know: to do all those things that many people within one's own organization expect one to do, and to give all those answers that many of them expect one to have. </p>
<p><i>
[Spoiler alert: We don't always have them. We don't always look for them. And some of them we don't care about, truth be told].</i></p>
<p>
Anyway, there I was, a living being who usually prefers the company of musty papers to that of living, breathing, questioning humans, surrounded by a gaggle of kiddies. Two dozen little bonsási of a person making a fuss, fiddling with everything, messing everything up (oh, gods of Valhalla...) and looking at me as if I had stepped out of one of the drawers in which we stored ancient manuscripts. </p>
<p><i>
[Such a perception was not too wrong, by the way].</i></p>
<p>
I started telling them why we existed. What we did. What benefits our work had for the community. Why they had to come day in and day out to fill our reading room (besides for the official photo, of course). And after those delightful paragraphs of institutional promotion —those that usually leave a taste in my mouth that mixes bile with sulfuric acid— I showed them some of the artifacts / documents in our archival collection. </p>
<p>
3 ½ or 5 ¼ floppy disks, ZIP disks, DATs, CDs... A select sample of a huge documentary collection that I myself had patiently built, organized, described and curated, many times rescuing material from the very trash cans. </p>
<p><i>
[Yep. I have the soul of a waste picker. So what?]</i></p>
<p>
Those kids looked at the materials I was holding in my hands as if I were showing them objects fresh from the tomb of Hatshepsut or the library of Assur-bani-apli. They were equally unfamiliar to them, equally unintelligible. And, I must say, equally ridiculous: was there, in that little plastic square, less than a megabyte of information stored? Was anyone happy —or proud— to handle information that way? Or to listen to music using a long, thin, brown tape that got tangled up for nothing and that, if brought near a magnet, would be erased? What's more, how was it all shared? How was it sent to a friend, an acquaintance? </p>
<p><i>
["By physical mail,” responded a candid me to this last question. Imagine the faces...]</i></p>
<p>
I didn't just have to explain what each item was for and what bulky, convoluted, imperfect devices were needed to read or operate them. I also had to explain the context. What those of us who lived with that technology —which, for my very young audience, had very little in the way of "technology"— felt and did. I told them, for example, that to install a computer program on a computer required 15, 20 or 30 floppy disks (those "little plastic squares" in front of them), which had to be placed in the reader in the correct sequence (and fingers crossed that none of them would be damaged, and that there would not be a power cut during the long period of time it took to install them). </p>
<p>
To increase their surprise and their expressions of pity towards me... </p>
<p><i>
[And here comes to me a joke from the comic strip "Mafalda", by the Argentine humorist Quino. Mafalda asks her father, "Dad, when you were a kid, what TV show did you like the most?" The father replies that when he was a boy there was no television. Mafalda then asks, "And what were you a kid for then? What a fool!"]</i></p>
<p>
...I told them that I was showing them digital / computer things, which appeared in the world when I was about 15 years old, but that, before that, things were much more... </p>
<p>
...more... </p>
<p>
..."primitive", let's say. </p>
<p><i>
[People of my generation or earlier: please don't hate me. And, again, imagine the faces of my audience...].</i></p>
<p>
I then showed them films of the kind used with an overhead projector to give a lecture ("this was our PowerPoint", I pointed out...), 35 mm films and VHS videos ("this was our Netflix", I pointed out...), audio cassettes ("this was our Spotify", I lamented...), slides ("this was our Instagram", I cried...). </p>
<p>
I even risked telling them that, in order not to waste the batteries of our walkmans ("walk-whaaaaat?"), we would rewind the cassettes of our favorite music with the help of a pen. </p>
<p><i>
[In my time, doing that was pure awesomeness... You had to have an excellent wrist technique... That was innovation, and the rest was just a story!]</i></p>
<p>
The looks oscillated between the most absolute amazement and the most infinite pity. They were receiving a sort of archeology lesson from a sort of recently thawed caveman who, to make matters worse, seemed to consider that all those antiques he was showing were a sort of treasure. </p>
<p>
Finally, my talk ended. And they left, muttering among themselves, and looking at me as if I had just stepped out of Marty McFly's DeLorean in an inverted version of the famous Zemeckis movie. </p>
<p><i>
[And here another "Mafalda" joke comes to my mind. A friend asks the girl: "Where was your daddy born?" After some thought, she answers: "He told me that when he was a boy he didn't know television, nor nylon, nor atomic energy, nor antibiotics, nor transistors, nor jet planes, nor artificial satellites, nor remote-controlled rockets, nor contact lenses. So he must have been born in Mato Grosso". For that child audience of mine, I must have been born in a corner of the Lascaux cave].</i></p>
<p>
Today, seen in perspective, the reaction of that group of young visitors does not seem strange to me, much less unexpected. In fact, and to be quite honest, I think it is precisely the reaction that I want to provoke nowadays among those who look at the collections that I keep in the archive: astonishment, incredulity... </p>
<p><i>
[...a little bit of pity...]</i></p>
<p>
...and perhaps, maybe, something of interest. Placing on a table, in a row, a succession of material supports of fixed image (photography), moving image (video), audio or electronic information, allows us to understand the gradual development of ideas and concepts of conservation and transmission of information. It allows us to see directly the trial and error, the formats that appeared and disappeared almost as if by magic because their results were not as expected, the technological revolutions, the solutions that always worked... All disciplines can show such movement / "evolution" / "progress" in their methods and materials, and information sciences are no exception. </p>
<p>
And it is understandable that for those who did not have those materials close to them, who did not live with them, they are an antiquity. How do we feel, those of us in our fifties, when we see the televisions of the 40's, the radios of the 30's, the telephones of the 20's, the telegraph? </p>
<p><i>
[Do we know how to send a telegram? Have we ever sent one?]</i></p>
<p>
In my direct experience, I think these things tend to make us laugh. But I understand that it is usually a laughter somewhere between curious and amazed. Probably because, deep down, we realize that we have history in front of us: a succession of events that have taken place in a period too short to be considered "history". We believe that history is made over decades, or centuries, but the reality is that history began yesterday. Or an hour ago. Or five minutes ago. And it grows and happens and unfolds before our eyes. </p>
<p>
Sometimes, in the span of a human lifetime, events of brutal amplitude happen at breakneck speed. Those of us who were born and grew up before the advent of the Internet can attest to this. </p>
<p>
The archives, and the materials stored in them —especially this type of material, so striking, so multiform, so subject to rapid changes and unstoppable evolutions— allow us to realize this phenomenon of "fast history". That we have been direct witnesses and protagonists of historical changes. In communications (do you remember the first time you sent an email?), in the handling of documents (do you remember the first time you made a photocopy?), or in the search for information (do you remember your first Internet search engine, before Google appeared?) </p>
<p>
I understand that it is for that very reason that, for many of us, being in contact with those materials brings us infinite nostalgia. We are touching history: our history, that of our families, friends, towns and societies... For me, seeing an audio cassette takes me back to the copies of Dire Straits I listened to when I was 18, when I started college. Holding a VHS tape in my hands reminds me of those rare movies that a group of very young and very cinephile friends of mine used to look for among the shelves of the neighborhood video store... The sounds produced by a fax machine, by the keys of a typewriter, by the early modems when connecting, by the Commodore 64 when loading a video game recorded from a cassette: all of that is part of my personal history. </p>
<p>
Of the history of a whole generation, in fact. </p>
<p>
Today, a discipline, "media archeology", is devoted to recovering that memory, studying it, giving it a meaning and, above all, a context. There are even online projects that recover those sounds I just mentioned above and revive them for us, the old nostalgic ones: the sounds of the first video games, of the video cassette players rewinding the tape, of the turntable needle when touching the surface of the vinyl LP... And we recover series and more series of this kind of material in our archives. And we treasure them, and show them, and try to make sense of them — even if people look at us like weirdos. </p>
<p>
"But what do you want that for in the archive?" they keep asking me (a question I've already explored in these "Letters...") "All that content is already digitized on the Internet!" Aha, they most certainly are. But it's not about the content. It's about the containers. The materiality of those things, the physical object and its characteristics, and all the emotionality and experiences linked to such elements. </p>
<p>
And it is about that magic that happens when one really understands what is the meaning, the value and the power of one of "those old things we have around here...". </p>

I know that they can burn books, raze libraries, ban languages, banish beliefs, erase pasts, erase presents, order futures, torture and execute people. But I also know that they have not yet discovered how to kill the intangible and luminous body of an idea, a dream, or a hope (E. Civallero. Head of the blog <i>Bitácora de un bibliotecario</i> between 2004 and 2014).</p>
