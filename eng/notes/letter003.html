<p>
In a previous text I shared with you (or, at least, with those who ventured to read the first of this series of "Letters from the Library") the astonishment of many people who, to this day, still do not understand what those of us who manage knowledge and memory do for a living. </p>
<p>
Among these astonished people are many scientists. </p>
<p>
No wonder. In a compilation she published in 2017, the renowned American historian of science Lorraine Daston noted that "...archival research is assumed to be ipso facto historical in nature, and any archive to be of the sort prototypically investigated by historians: a fixed place with a curated, often official collection consisting mostly of old unpublished papers." She added that "...archives are mostly invisible in accounts of the sites and practices of science." </p>
<p>
Bottom line: archives remain those stereotypical dusty, forgotten spaces that only a few Indiana-Jonesque historians venture into to try to make order and sense out of a series of old, crumbling papers that may give them a clue to some unknown incident in the distant past. </p>
<p>
However, and as I mentioned in the previous installment of these letters of mine, for some time now —let's say, in the last two or three decades— many professionals of knowledge and memory management have dedicated ourselves to reformulate our profession and our activity a bit. To realize that archives do not only tell the big stories, nor do they only include the big papers. </p>
<p>
To put our gaze on the details. </p>
<p>
Since such a repositioning, our work has suddenly become very interesting (it already was, in fact, but the circumstances have improved a lot). Diversity increased, voices were reproduced as if by magic, possibilities multiplied exponentially... We realized that behind each small fragment of paper, each slide, each card or drawing, a whole bunch of stories were intertwined, whispering (or yelling) the adventures and misadventures of a whole bunch of other people. An entire universe of colorful characters and unique narratives. </p>
<p>
And so, almost without knowing or expecting it, stories appeared everywhere in the archive. </p>
<p>
In every corner. On every shelf. </p>
<p>
And you will correct me if I am wrong in the following statement, but it seems to me that everyone loves a good story. Especially the juicy anecdote, the piquant detail, the freshly baked gossip, the witty invention, the epic endurance, the tragic melodrama... We may not know the dates of Napoleon's or Bolivar's battles, but I'm sure we do know a couple of gossipy details about them. Like the height of the former. Or the passionate loves of the latter. </p>
<p><i>
["Folks looooooooove gossip, my dear..." my great aunt used to say — a good connoisseur and practitioner of the gossiping trade herself. And she wasn't wrong...]</i></p>
<p>
These stories, all of them, are the varied threads that make up our social and collective memory. And we, librarians, archivists and museologists, we are their weavers. </p>
<p><i>
[Says Australian archivist Sue McKermmish (an authority on the subject of memory and archives) that "human beings are the sum of their memories", and that "the nature of their interaction with other humans, indeed their very identity, is determined by their memories"].</i></p>
<p>
Like good craftsmen, those of us who do what I do for a living are unwilling to discard any of those threads. Many of us have learned to detect and identify the many underlying possibilities. As a result, we end up keeping items in our collections that, to outside eyes, seem worthless. And then we have to listen to the eternal, shocked question. </p>
<p>
"What do you want that in the Archive for?" </p>
<p><i>
[Eyebrows raised, eyes wide open, fright in the voice. Sometimes hands to the head and other vehement gesticulations. On select and memorable occasions, interlocutors ruffling their hair and tearing their clothes apart... Trust me: after so many years in the trade, I've seen it all...]</i></p>
<p>
"What do you want that in the Archive for?" they ask. Yeap. As if I were taking up the "important stuff" place with junk. </p>
<p>
But we know that there, behind that supposed "minutia", there is a whole story to be told. </p>
<p>
Or many, if you will. </p>
<p>
It happened to me a few years ago with a little piece of paper napkin I found at the bottom of a dusty box in the Galapagos Islands. </p>
<p><i>
[Imagine that. A little piece of napkin. From a cafeteria. Stored in my Archive].</i></p>
<p>
The slip of paper in question had a date, a place, a scientific name, and the signature of the person who had made the notation. It was crumpled and moldy. "What do you want that in the Archive for?", the question echoed around me again. I didn't think much of that note... until it dawned on me that it documented a sighting. I ended up finding out that that document —any material encoding a fragment of information is one— reported the presence of a marine mammal in a specific point of the Galapagos geography many years before the first recorded citation in the academic bibliography. </p>
<p><i>
[Why had that little piece of paper not been taken into account until then? Probably because the person who signed it was not a scientist but an unknown tour guide. And history, after all, is usually written by the powerful. </i></p>
<p><i>
And... of course, because it was a napkin. What biologists, what historians, what academic authorities would be willing to support their assertions on a napkin?]</i></p>
<p>
The same thing has been happening to me in our institution, especially when it comes to asking the people who make up our teams not to discard or throw away papers. Don't throw anything away, actually. Because many of those elements that these people consider "useless" can be very valuable if you know how to put them in context. Or if you know how to see the threads that run through them, the voices they preserve... "What do you want that in the archive for?" they ask me, somewhat annoyed. "Let me throw it away! It's nothing but trash!" Maybe some of it is, and I'll see to shredding and discarding it myself. But I'll bet you anything that in every one of those boxes they seek to wipe off the map there is much to be salvaged. </p>
<p>
For example, field notebooks with unique drawings, sketched with a pencil in some corner of the Panamanian forest half a century ago. Or the preliminary outlines of the trails to be visited in a certain Natural Monument. Or lists with banding data of certain bird species. Or three hundred photographs of certain archaeological excavations that marked a milestone in Central American history. Or the original drawings of the first book with the description of a certain biological group... </p>
<p>
So, the next time you are going to discard old papers, think that those of us who work in my line of action can preserve them, and look at them from other perspectives, and tell stories with them. </p>
<p>
And the next time you go into an archive and find a hodgepodge of objects, each more diverse and curious than the next, don't ask "what do you want that for...?" </p>
<p>
Ask, rather, for the story behind them. We will be more than happy to tell you everything about it. </p>

I know that they can burn books, raze libraries, ban languages, banish beliefs, erase pasts, erase presents, order futures, torture and execute people. But I also know that they have not yet discovered how to kill the intangible and luminous body of an idea, a dream, or a hope (E. Civallero. Head of the blog <i>Bitácora de un bibliotecario</i> between 2004 and 2014).</p>
