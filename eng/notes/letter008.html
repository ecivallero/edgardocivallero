<p>
"This library is always empty — a library should be full of people...!" </p>
<p><i>
[Ohmygoooooooooooood...].</i></p>
<p>
No matter when you read this: the saying "for a library to be a real library, it has to be full of people" has been around since the mid-19th century. To this day. </p>
<p><i>
[Literally. I just heard it this very morning. Ohmygoooooooooooood...]</i></p>
<p>
I'm not sure when that comment originated. It's hard to imagine it being used in earlier times. I can't picture, let's say, Sargon of Nineveh, "lord of the totality of the four corners of the universe, including all its regents"...</p>
<p><i>
[Yep, that's what he called himself, the modest fellow. Šar kiššat kibrāte ša napḫar malkī kalîšunu. He recorded that in cuneiform on murals in Nineveh, the Assyrian capital].</i></p>
<p>
...saying to his chief librarian: "Hey, mate, this library is empty… Do me a favor and fill it up, will ya?" </p>
<p><i>
[This Sargon of mine came out sort-of Australian... Sorry...].</i></p>
<p>
What I'm getting at is that the phrase "the library is empty, you have to fill it with people" is one we hear a lot in my line of work. In a world where effectiveness and impact are measured by numbers, not by process characteristics or qualitative elements, a library whose weekly statistics do not hit certain targets risks losing funding, staff and, in the long run, closing down. </p>
<p><i>
[Sometimes decision makers do not wait for the "long run" and move straight to sudden closure. I think I've mentioned before, in another of these letters, that my profession can be quite dramatic, haven't I? "Exciting and challenging," they say...]</i></p>
<p>
To save their necks, many library (and archive, and museum) workers "inflate" the numbers. </p>
<p><i>
[Nothing new here. Don't look shocked].</i></p>
<p>
No matter the innovation in the services, the detail in the activities, the beauty of the products and final results, or the proposals thought out in the long term to ensure sustainability: if our reading rooms are not packed with people, if the graphs do not climb off the PowerPoint and up the wall to the ceiling, our results are deemed unacceptable. </p>
<p>
And the question hanging over our heads like the sword of Damocles is: "What's the point of having a library if it is not delivering the expected results?" </p>
<p><i>
[Emoji of teary face. Emoji of a sad face. Kitten GIF. More kitten GIFs. As many kitten GIFs as you have...].</i></p>
<p>
Librarians (and archivists and museologists, though less so) are a contentious guild. At the end of the last century, we were living happily with our books, and our catalogs, and our stuff, and our bustling reading rooms. Then the internet arrived. </p>
<p>
1I admit without shame that it felt like a right punch to the jaw with a glove filled with screws. </p>
<p>
And just a couple of years later we got the e-book. Hook to the liver, technical KO in the first round, referee counting to ten, and we were lying there not knowing what hit us or how it happened. </p>
<p>
We faced a massive identity crisis. "What are we good for now, what do we exist for, if what we do has no value, if everything is on the internet, if Google answers all the questions? Why do we accumulate books on our shelves if any John-of-the-Winds can carry two or three thousand digital books in a little device the size of a handkerchief?" </p>
<p><i>
[I don't know if you have any kitten GIFs left, or weepy, sad little faces. Add them here at your leisure].</i></p>
<p>
It was around that time —the beginning of the new millennium: longed-for times, when I was young and had hair...— that we began to redefine our name. We could no longer be "librarians". The word "library" derived from a Latin root that means "book". But the world no longer seemed to need books. "Info-brarians"? "Information scientists"? "Documentalists"? "Professionals in the knowledge disciplines"? No one knew where to go. Nobody knew what to do. </p>
<p>
What we did know was that, as if by magic, our reading rooms had begun to empty. Loans had been dwindling. Queries had been scarce. And our supervisors and bosses, our private Sargons, sitting in their offices and looking at our statistics, had started to say, "mate, this library is empty...". </p>
<p>
We told ourselves then that it was necessary to dive headlong into this new digital world — the one that had fallen on us like an ACME brand trap successfully launched by the coyote on duty against us, poor roadrunners who were not running at all. We learned to move on the Internet, yes, and we created digital libraries... In fact, we changed the paradigm so much that we forgot who we were —and I'm talking about centuries of history here— and we became something else. "The library will be digital or it won't be," said some enlightened library guru; "the book is dead," said another of those poor devils... </p>
<p>
And our confusion and our stress and anxiety levels went up, up, up. And our stats went down, down, down. </p>
<p><i>
[GIF of sad little Korean girl. More GIFs of other equally sad little girls].</i></p>
<p>
To make matters worse, to top it all off and put the red-scarlet cherry on the summit of the cake, social networks arrived. People started to prefer to ask questions on LinkedIn, broadcast on Twitter, or share on Facebook instead of using libraries that were already half-forgotten and were starting to become a thing of the past. </p>
<p><i>
[So harsh was that perception of "libraries as a thing of the past" that many of my colleagues were quick to jettison anything that linked them, even slightly, to an "analog" or "paper-based" past. Thus, there were people who threw away their card catalogs, the result of years of work by generations and generations of careful librarians, or who made a gigantic hole in the desert and buried thousands of their paper journals because "what do we want them for when they are already digitized and a click away on the Internet...?"]</i></p>
<p><i>
[No one thought that this "click" away was going to cost them thousands of dollars... for something they had just buried in the desert. "La vida te da sorpresas, sorpresas te da la vida, ay Dios..."].</i></p>
<p>
As I was saying, people embraced social networks, the umpteenth technological boom of the decade. And we became the last lug in the jar, a zero seven hundred places to the left. </p>
<p>
But we didn't shrink back. We got on Instagram, we did Pinterest, we opened Facebook pages and Twitter accounts, we created blogs... What's more: we went overboard about five times, we were more papist than the Pope, and we stopped being librarians to become influencers who didn't know very well what they were showing, nor what discourse they were selling, nor who they were influencing, nor why, nor for what... </p>
<p>
The crisis of identity and values was absolute. But instead of stopping the ball in the middle of the field to see where the opposite goal was (we Argentines are very fond of soccer metaphors), we kept running, fleeing forward at full speed. </p>
<p>
The rooms, however, remained empty. </p>
<p>
At the same time, dark libraries and other pirate sites were growing and reproducing online like mushrooms, and anyone could have books that cost us law-abiding people a kidney and hit the shelves three months after everyone else had already read them. </p>
<p>
And TikTok became the new search engine for young people, who didn't even use Google anymore... </p>
<p>
...and we were there, paralyzed, or running back and forth saying "shit, shit, shit" like a bunch of chicks under an unexpected hailstorm. </p>
<p>
[GIF of a running chick. Emojis of chick head, chick coming out of egg, whole chick]. </p>
<p>
That's when we started inventing what we shouldn't have invented. And all because of statistics. </p>
<p>
With our reading rooms empty and our numbers down the drain, and with a bleak outlook all around us, and with our beloved Sargons cracking their whips over our shaking, chicken-like little heads, and not knowing quite what to do about it, a number of libraries around the world turned their rooms into something else. The point was to fill them. Some argued that they did not want those spaces to die of loneliness, but we all knew very well why they were doing it. The fact is that reading spaces were transformed into cafes, gyms, video game rooms, chill-outs, lounges, art galleries, concert halls... </p>
<p>
Even places to take a quick nap. </p>
<p>
In this way, many large libraries were able to achieve their goals through statistics that, in a way, were not real. Because a library is not an exhibition hall, nor a concert hall, nor an art gallery, nor a place to relax. It can be, of course, but in a complementary way, and as long as these activities serve the primary objectives of the library: to manage knowledge and memory. </p>
<p>
Think about it: what is the difference between an art exhibition in a gallery and one in a library? Leaving aside the fact that a gallery is an expert in carrying out these activities and dedicates 100% of its time to it, and a library is not, the main difference should be the objectives. A library should not exhibit just for the sake of exhibiting: galleries already do that (and much better, because, as I say, they are 100% dedicated to it). A library should exhibit so that the materials exhibited serve as a gateway to its collections, to its documents. The exhibition is an excuse for attendees to enter a "knowledge route" carefully designed in advance: one that, from each element of the exhibition, brings the interested party into the collection and allows them to tour it, discover it and understand it, and provides doors and windows attached to other routes and other complementary documents. </p>
<p>
The same happens with a concert. With the presentation of a book. With video games. </p>
<p><i>
[Let's forget about coffee, gym and siesta. They always seemed to me as nonsense, products of desperation].</i></p>
<p>
While we librarians were discussing all this, the pandemic fell upon us. It was the <i>coup de grâce</i>: as if Sisyphus' damned stone, in addition to rolling downhill for the infinitesimal time, had crushed him as well. People all over the world discovered (by force, against their will, but they did) that they didn't have to go anywhere in person: that practically everything could be done without leaving home. In pajamas. Or without. </p>
<p>
And then came artificial intelligence. </p>
<p>
Yeap. </p>
<p><i>
[I don't know about you. I ran out of emojis. And GIFs].</i></p>
<p>
Today many libraries are still empty. A lot of them. If tumbleweeds were rolling through our reading rooms, we probably wouldn't be amazed. </p>
<p><i>
[What's more: we would probably run after them offering them the latest edition of...].</i></p>
<p>
However, that does not mean we are not doing our job. We are concerned with maintaining the integrity and health of our physical collections, understanding and maintaining our virtual collections, and seeing how to connect those collections of knowledge and memory to the community. Because that, in my view, is what a library (or whatever they are calling it these days) is: a space, physical or virtual, where people can connect with knowledge and memories. Nothing more. And nothing less. </p>
<p>
We continue with our identity crises, with our chicks-under-the-hail behavior. We continue to wonder why we exist. Sometimes we ask ChatGPT, or some other artificial intelligence. ChatGPT reaches out a virtual hand and pats us on the shoulder, and fills our glass with <i>aguardiente antioqueño</i> while Paquita la del Barrio's "Rata de dos patas" plays, and says nothing. What is it going to say? </p>
<p>
I know that eventually we will find our way. A path that will go through accepting what we have always done, understanding that it is something valuable, stop chasing novelties as if not embracing them would mean the end of us, embrace technologies as a tool (and not as an end in itself), stop keeping up with fashions and trends, and have a good plan. I am convinced that, with a good plan, bringing people to the library will be feasible. </p>
<p>
People coming <i>to the library</i>. To use the library and its collections. Not (just) people coming to relax, or to use the internet, or to hang out because it's cool inside and hot outside. That's not a "vibrant community." Not at all. </p>
<p>
To get them to come to the library, we need to show them why what we librarians do is valuable, and how our services and products, in person or online, can be useful to their work and interests. </p>
<p>
It turns out that, for that to happen, we first have to understand (and accept) it ourselves. </p>
<p>
And then, our Sargons on duty. </p>

I know that they can burn books, raze libraries, ban languages, banish beliefs, erase pasts, erase presents, order futures, torture and execute people. But I also know that they have not yet discovered how to kill the intangible and luminous body of an idea, a dream, or a hope (E. Civallero.
