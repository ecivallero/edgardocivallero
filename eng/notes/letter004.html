<p>
Among his many masterpieces of German Renaissance art, the painter Albrecht Dürer produced, around 1498, a self-portrait. </p>
<p>
I remember —as if I were living it all over again as I type these words— the moment when I had it for the first time in front of me. I was 12 years old, I was an introverted child and immigrant in a strange land, I adored art, and I was setting foot for the first time in the Prado Museum, in Madrid: a real dream come true for that project of a person that I still was at that time. </p>
<p>
I found the painting in question in a corner. It was —and still is— much smaller than I had imagined, and at the same time much more beautiful. And it was exactly at the moment when I looked at that portrait that I realized that the author was looking back at me from the surface of that oil painting. Through the centuries. </p>
<p>
I remember looking around me, dumbfounded, and thinking, not without a little awe, that in every portrait hanging in the many rooms of that museum there were people looking at me from the other side of time and silence. Some were smiling, others were serious. And I understood, a little diffusely (I was 12), that this was another of the many human attempts to escape death and oblivion, and to achieve a certain immortality. </p>
<p>
Because if we are remembered, we do not die at all. </p>
<p><i>
[Orhan Pamuk, the Turkish novelist who won the Nobel Prize for literature in 2006, once wrote that museums are places where time is transformed into space...].</i></p>
<p>
From that point on in my personal chronology, in every museum I visited —and there have been so many in all these decades of life— I was not only impressed by the appearance and the message of the artworks. I also looked for the people behind them. And not only those represented, but also the representers, the makers, the artists. In this way I noticed the brush and spatula strokes that could be seen on the surfaces of the canvases, or the marks of the potters' fingers on this or that vessel, or the traces of the calamus on the papyri, or the knots and the crosses of fibers in the baskets... </p>
<p><i>
[And, especially, I noticed the mistakes. You could say that I was looking for them: the erasures, the crossings out, a badly made knot in a weaving, a badly thought-out crossing in a basket, a detail out of symmetry in a ceramic... Errors are (or use to be) tangible proof that a human being was there].</i></p>
<p>
When I started studying library science, I was passionate about subjects that had to do with the direct handling of documents. Especially the paleography course, in which I worked with colonial notarial texts from the 17th century in the city of Córdoba, Argentina. The pen strokes, the crossings out, the glosses, the abbreviations, the choice of this or that term: the person who produced the document was there, still alive. Besides the fact that they gave clues about the historical moment, or provided vital information about the social, economic, and political processes of those past times, those papers presented the physical, tangible marks of the presence of a real person. One who had breathed on those sheets and who had left his fingerprints on them more than three hundred years before. </p>
<p>
At university, librarians are not taught to look at these details. Neither at these nor at any other. We are usually educated to see certain elements in a document, and little else — an approach that is too technical, rather limited, and that often loses a certain humanity and all creativity. For the more orthodox and hard line of my profession, to deviate from that aseptic and "objective" approach to librarian work is typical of dreamers, quixotes, literates... and failed imbeciles. It is not librarianship, but something else. </p>
<p>
Thus, a paleographic analysis, which for me has always been a small window through which to peer into the past, for them is a simple and plain transcription. Period. </p>
<p>
In that context, I couldn't help being a quixote (or a failed imbecile?): little by little I became more and more interested in the little things that gave away the people behind them. Marginalia, for example —which I have already mentioned in a previous post— are for me an inexhaustible source of surprises and amusement. </p>
<p>
[A whole universe of comments, insults, remarks, insults, corrections, insults, obscenities...] </i></p>
<p><i>
[...insults...]</i></p>
<p>
So are ("inexhaustible source of surprises and fun", I mean — forget the insults) the small fragments of documents that, in order to be understood, require a lot of detective work. Or those imperceptible winks to the reader that appear strategically placed here and there. Or those elements that, if you look closely, say a lot about the character of the person who produced them, or about his/her mood at that moment, or about his/her situation... </p>
<p>
I love to look at those details. Because they tell stories (and, as I said in my previous post, <i>everyone loves a good story</i>). And because they give me access to the universe behind the curtain: to the personal <i>quilombos</i> ("messes", in Argentinean Spanish), to the fights, to the brawls, to the palace intrigues, to the betrayals... </p>
<p>
To love affairs... </p>
<p>
I remember that some years ago I told, in a series of letters very similar to this one (but in a very different institution), the story of a love postcard that I found in an abandoned box in the archive. Honestly, I never managed to find out how that card got to the institutional archive, nor why it was kept; I guess someone saved it and then, shuffled and hidden among so many old papers, it went unnoticed. </p>
<p>
But not for me. </p>
<p><i>
[Insert here the musical motif from Morricone's "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly". Yes, the little whistle. Too-tee-too-tee-tooooo... And Clint Eastwood's look from under his hat].</i></p>
<p>
It was a letter from a scholar woman who, at a conference, had met one of the scientists at my institution and had had what seemed a torrid (really torrid) affair with him. After the event, they had separated. But, apparently, she had not been able to forget him. And, since he had kept the postcard, it seemed that he hadn't either. The curious fact was that there were no names in the text, only initials, so we didn't know exactly who they were. </p>
<p>
The story sparked passions and interest. I had the members of my institution, from the highest to the lowest level, racking their brains for weeks to find out the identity of the lovers. We finally succeeded. To our disappointment, they had not ended up together. It had been a failed love story. A sad ending. </p>
<p>
Eventually I ended up talking to one of them. Him. An old man already, and the only survivor of that unlikely couple. And when I told him the story of that postcard, his eyes filled with tears. Although he had married, raised a family and was a happy grandfather of half a dozen grandchildren, he told me he had missed the woman on the postcard every day of his life, and always wondered what would have happened if.... </p>
<p><i>
[I know: sounds moviey. Weepy Saturday-night Netflix romantic comedy. But I swear it's true and real].</i></p>
<p>
What importance could such a corny anecdote have in a scientific institution? In orthodox academic terms, none. However, from a broader and more comprehensive approach, it has a lot. It reminds us that researchers or scientists are human beings with their own stories, worries, dreams, a horrible personality, or an eternal smile on their faces. It shows us that behind things, behind tangible cultural heritage, there are always people — persons like us. As I have already said in other of these letters, behind every element in this world there is a story. A story made of small fragments. </p>
<p>
And so, we learn that the discovery of a particular species of rainforest bird was preceded by two weeks of tick bites and uncontrollable explosive diarrhea and had very little glorious about it — and that all this was reflected in the curious and incomprehensible scientific name of the bird in question. Or that the voyages of exploration on that picturesque river ended in the wedding of two of those involved — a wedding from which offspring were born who continued the work of their progenitors in the same place, on the same topic. Or even that this or that respected Academy personality was, in practice, an emotional abuser. An absolute bastard. Or worse. </p>
<p>
Seeing the people behind things, especially in science, helps to humanize the discourse, sometimes too "objective" and aseptic and sometimes too heroic and epic. It helps to enrich the story and the perspective, to make it broader and more diverse, and to include in the narrative a lot of characters, situations and events that, although they seem silly and anecdotal, become significant once they are grouped together. </p>
<p>
And, above all, it helps connect us to those times and places where those events happened. Where those people, all those people, were. </p>
<p>
So, from now on, when you look at a painting, or an old photograph, or a slide from three decades ago, or a pre-Hispanic statuette, or even an Instagram post or a Tiktok video, I invite you to look a little further: at the people who return your gaze, and at all those who put their hands at the service of preserving our knowledge and memories. You will discover a whole world. Many, in fact. </p>
<p>
And you will see the same thing that some of us who preserve human knowledge and memory see every time we approach one of these documents. </p>

I know that they can burn books, raze libraries, ban languages, banish beliefs, erase pasts, erase presents, order futures, torture and execute people. But I also know that they have not yet discovered how to kill the intangible and luminous body of an idea, a dream, or a hope (E. Civallero. Head of the blog <i>Bitácora de un bibliotecario</i> between 2004 and 2014).</p>
