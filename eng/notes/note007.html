This note is part of a series that challenges the status quo of "green libraries," exposing greenwashing and tokenism, and exploring viable alternatives, such as minimalism, degrowth, upcycling, and "slow libraries."

<p><b>
Introduction</b></p>
<p>
Nature is the most efficient designer the world has ever known. Every ecosystem operates on principles of balance, regeneration, and resource optimization — without waste, without excess. In stark contrast, human institutions, including libraries, have long been built on models of overconsumption, inefficiency, and unsustainable growth.</p>
<p>
What if libraries stopped looking to industrial models of sustainability —often riddled with greenwashing— and instead turned to nature itself for solutions?</p>
<p>
Biomimicry offers precisely that: an approach that looks to the systems, structures, and strategies found in nature to inspire sustainable, regenerative designs. Instead of merely reducing harm, biomimicry encourages libraries to rethink how they function at the most fundamental level — how they design their spaces, manage their materials, and operate within their communities. If the so-called "green libraries" movement was just a surface-level shift, biomimicry represents a deep transformation, one that challenges libraries to evolve into living, responsive systems, much like the ecosystems they are meant to serve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>
What is Biomimicry?</b></p>
<p>
Biomimicry is the practice of studying and emulating nature's strategies to solve human design challenges. It is not about superficially imitating natural aesthetics, but rather about deeply understanding how organisms and ecosystems function and applying those lessons to human-built systems. The core principles of biomimicry —efficiency, adaptability, resilience, and circularity— stand in direct opposition to the extractive, waste-heavy models libraries currently follow.</p>
<p>
Consider how forests self-regulate their waste, how coral reefs create complex networks of resource-sharing, or how termite mounds maintain temperature stability through natural ventilation. These are not just interesting biological phenomena; they are potential blueprints for how libraries could be designed and operated to be more sustainable, energy-efficient, and community-centered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>
Biomimicry in Library Architecture</b></p>
<p>
Libraries continue to be built with high-impact materials like concrete, steel, and massive glass facades, all of which come with devastating environmental costs. Biomimicry offers an alternative: nature-inspired architecture that adapts to local conditions rather than forcing a one-size-fits-all model onto every new library construction.</p>
<p>
For instance, architects have studied termite mounds to design buildings that maintain stable internal temperatures without relying on air conditioning. The Eastgate Centre in Zimbabwe, modeled after termite mound ventilation, uses natural airflow to regulate indoor climates, significantly reducing energy use. Imagine libraries designed with this principle, where passive cooling replaces the need for energy-intensive HVAC systems.</p>
<p>
Another example comes from biophilic design, which incorporates elements like green roofs, natural materials, and water recycling systems to create library spaces that function more like living ecosystems. The Singapore National Library, for example, uses an eco-friendly double-skin facade that reduces heat absorption, lowering cooling costs while maintaining natural light. These principles could be applied in libraries worldwide, moving away from wasteful, resource-intensive construction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>
Biomimicry in Library Operations</b></p>
<p>
Beyond architecture, biomimicry can reshape the way libraries operate. Ecosystems function through closed-loop cycles, where nothing goes to waste. Libraries, in contrast, are still stuck in linear models — books are acquired, used, discarded; furniture and technology are replaced rather than repaired; energy is consumed with little regard for efficiency.</p>
<p>
If libraries were to function like ecosystems, they would prioritize regenerative systems over linear consumption. This could mean embracing circular resource management, where materials are continuously repurposed. For example, libraries could borrow from fungal networks, which break down organic matter and redistribute nutrients, by establishing community-driven networks where old books, furniture, and even digital resources are constantly reintegrated rather than discarded.</p>
<p>
Biomimicry can also revolutionize energy consumption in libraries. Consider how desert plants manage water — through deep-rooted systems that store and distribute moisture efficiently. Libraries in arid climates could implement similar water-harvesting and cooling strategies, using structures that collect and redirect rainwater, minimizing waste while reducing dependence on external energy sources.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>
Lessons from Biomimicry in Other Fields</b></p>
<p>
The most powerful examples of biomimicry often come from outside the library sector, but they hold transformative potential if adapted properly.</p>
<p>
In the fashion industry, designers have created self-repairing fabrics inspired by squid proteins — what if library materials, from book covers to seating fabrics, were made of materials that could repair themselves, reducing replacement costs and material waste?</p>
<p>
In urban planning, some cities have begun modeling transportation networks on ant colony optimization, allowing for smoother, more efficient movement. Libraries could use similar strategies to improve book circulation systems, reducing unnecessary movement of materials and streamlining workflows to minimize labor and energy costs.</p>
<p>
In technology, researchers are designing biodegradable electronics inspired by leaf decomposition, proving that the toxic e-waste libraries generate through outdated technology could one day be replaced by sustainable, compostable alternatives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>
Practical Steps for Libraries to Embrace Biomimicry</b></p>
<p>
Shifting to a biomimicry-based model requires a fundamental change in mindset, but it is not an unattainable goal. Libraries can begin by studying their own environments and asking: what natural systems exist here that can guide better decision-making? The key is contextual adaptation — instead of applying a generic sustainability checklist, libraries must learn from the ecosystems they inhabit.</p>
<p>
This could mean using locally sourced, regenerative materials in new library construction, mirroring the way nature builds with what is available. It could also involve rethinking resource cycles — instead of discarding old books and technology, libraries can create repair and reuse programs that mimic nature's principle of continuous renewal. By partnering with biologists, engineers, and designers, libraries can push for more innovative approaches that challenge outdated, inefficient library models.</p>
<p>
But perhaps the most radical step is rethinking how libraries themselves function within the broader environment. Nature doesn't separate itself from the world — it is deeply interconnected. Libraries, too, must move beyond their institutional walls, integrating with local communities, fostering shared resource networks, and designing learning environments that reflect the intelligence of nature itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>
Nature as the Ultimate Guide</b></p>
<p>
For too long, libraries have borrowed their sustainability models from corporate greenwashing, adopting technologies and certifications that fail to address the root of the environmental crisis.</p>
<p>
Biomimicry offers something fundamentally different — it asks libraries to stop thinking like industrial systems and start thinking like living organisms. Instead of fighting against natural constraints, libraries can work with them, designing spaces and systems that don't just minimize harm but actively regenerate and contribute to the world around them.</p>
<p>
Nature has been perfecting sustainability for billions of years. It's time for libraries to start paying attention.</p>

I know that they can burn books, raze libraries, ban languages, banish beliefs, erase pasts, erase presents, order futures, torture and execute people. But I also know that they have not yet discovered how to kill the intangible and luminous body of an idea, a dream, or a hope (E. Civallero.
