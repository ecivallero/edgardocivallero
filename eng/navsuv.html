<h3>Federated Meanings, Symbiotic Archives, and the Violence of the Written Interface </h3>

<p>
What binds a micro-thesaurus, a fungal network, an inter-institutional metadata exchange, and a person who cannot read the signs in a public library? During the past two weeks, I traced a single, continuous line across these disparate terrains: the politics of relation. Whether the setting is semantic modeling, ecological analogy, or the ethics of access, each piece interrogates how systems remember, connect, and exclude — and how meaning emerges not from isolated entities but from the infrastructures that allow them to coexist.</p>
<p>
In <a href="blog/b062-micro-thesauri-and-relational-logics.html" target="_blank" title="Micro-Thesauri and Relational Logics"><i>Micro-Thesauri and Relational Logics</i></a>, the <i>Metadata as Revolt</i> series moves from sabotage to construction — from exposing the violence of universality to outlining a practical architecture of plurality. Here, the macro-vocabularies that dominate global knowledge infrastructures (LCSH, AAT, Darwin Core) are revealed not as neutral harmonizers but as machines of semantic compression. Against them, the text proposes micro-thesauri: small, situated, accountable vocabularies whose authority derives from context rather than scale. Their governing principle is not inheritance but relation — a shift that transforms metadata from hierarchy to negotiation. What emerges is a federated semantic ecology built from proximity, provenance, and explicit mapping. A quiet revolution of scale.</p>
<p>
From semantic federations the reflection turns toward ecological ones. <a href="blog/b063-interoperability-as-symbiosis.html" target="_blank" title="Interoperability as Symbiosis"><i>Interoperability as Symbiosis</i></a> reframes a foundational concept of digital librarianship by breaking it open along ethical and biological lines. Interoperability, long reduced to a technical achievement, becomes here an ecological condition: a form of co-existence in which institutions, records, and users survive through interdependence. Mechanical alignment is replaced by interpretive translation; provenance becomes polyprovenancial; preservation becomes the art of sustaining relation through change. The proposal is radical: treat interoperability as a mode of care, a mycelial ethics of linked memory in which stability arises not from uniformity but from adaptive entanglement.</p>
<p>
That same entanglement is explored narratively in the chronicle <a href="chronicles/c014-nothing-stands-alone.html" target="_blank" title="Nothing Stands Alone"><i>Nothing Stands Alone</i></a>, where the Andean cloud forest becomes a mirror for the archive’s future. Mycorrhizal networks — the fungal infrastructure through which forests share nutrients and warnings — offer a biological grammar for post-custodial memory systems. Meaning, that text suggests, is not an intrinsic property but a metabolic relation; documents live only insofar as they circulate. The chronicle extends the theoretical work by grounding it in ecological presence: decay as continuity, redundancy as resilience, and connection as the fundamental unit of survival. This is not metaphor as ornament; it is metaphor as method, a reorientation of archival thought through the epistemic logic of the forest floor.</p>
<p>
Finally, <a href="notes/n019-the-illiterate-user.html" target="_blank" title="The Illiterate User"><i>The Illiterate User</i></a> confronts a different kind of relation: the one libraries too often refuse. If the previous texts imagine infrastructures that thrive on plurality, this note exposes the institutional spaces that impose a singular way of being: literate, textual, compliant. The library, cloaked in hospitality, assumes reading as the price of admission. Illiteracy becomes defect; the user becomes problem; shame becomes policy. Against this, the piece calls for a library that does not require textual obedience — a space where knowledge can be exchanged through voice, gesture, memory, or community; where access is not contingent on literacy; where the right <i>not</i> to read is recognized as legitimate. This critique is not ancillary to the previous themes: it is their ethical anchor. If micro-thesauri distribute authority and mycelial archives distribute survival, then a non-literate library must distribute dignity.</p>
<p>
Across these four works, a single proposition crystallizes: that memory, meaning, and access are never properties of isolated objects or individuals, but always the outcome of relations — semantic, ecological, social. The task ahead is to design infrastructures that honor that truth: systems that do not require homogenization to connect, or literacy to include; systems that metabolize change rather than deny it; systems that speak in many registers, and listen in many more.</p>

<i>Navsuv</i> offers a biweekly synthesis of my work: blog posts, critical notes, articles, archival documents, and other materials. It's not just a summary — it's an editorial thread tracing how each piece fits into a shifting landscape of memory, critique, and resistance.</p>
<p>
The name comes from the language of the Sivdara, a fictional people from a broader personal project I'm developing: a continent imagined as a space to explore knowledge, memory, and the tension between presence and erasure. In their tongue, <i>navsuv</i> names the rope-and-straw suspension bridges used to cross the naroow valleys, up in the mountains — ephemeral yet enduring paths stretched between worlds. Like this section.</p>
