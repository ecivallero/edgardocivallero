<h2>The Bi-Weekly Summary | 06–19.Oct.2025</h2>
<h3>Compost Librarianship, Critical Dublin Core, and the Tyranny of Literacy</h3>

<p>
What if description, preservation, and access stopped pretending to be neutral? The last two weeks I've written from that fault line, tracing how metadata, archives, and public services perform their politics — and how, when bent, they can also host refusal, decay, and listening.</p>
<p>
In <a href="blog/b058-the-critical-edges-of-dublin-core.html" title="The Critical Edges of Dublin Core" target="_blank"><i>The Critical Edges of Dublin Core</i></a>, I turned to one of the field’s simplest standards to ask how minimalism can become subversion. Dublin Core’s flatness is usually treated as weakness; however, that looseness allows disobedience. Each field — title, language, coverage — can be turned sideways to hold ambiguity and refusal. The schema that once served uniformity can, with care, describe opacity, collaboration, and absence.</p>
<p>
From there, the reflection decomposed naturally into <a href="blog/b059-librarianship-of-compost.html" title="Librarianship of Compost" target="_blank"><i>Librarianship of Compost</i></a> and its mirrored chronicle <a href="chronicles/c012-the-forest-does-not-forget.html" title="The Forest Does Not Forget" target="_blank"><i>The Forest Does Not Forget</i></a>. Both pieces imagine libraries and archives as ecological systems that remember through transformation. Against the preservation reflex — the industrial urge to freeze memory — I proposed an <i>ecosemiotic archivistics</i>: a practice that treats decay as continuity. Librarians become composters; metadata turns into humus; permanence gives way to fertility.</p>
<p>
Finally, <a href="notes/n017-programming-for-the-literate.html" title="Programming for the Literate" target="_blank"><i>Programming for the Literate</i></a> returned to the surface of the institution. If the previous texts explored infrastructures, this one addressed their public face. Most library programs, I argued, still orbit around reading and writing — rehearsing literacy as the only valid form of knowledge. Storytimes, workshops, and "inclusion" projects end up excluding those who learn by listening, moving, or remembering differently. A library that cannot hear remains half blind.</p>
<p>
Together, these writings draw a modest cartography of resistance: standards that bend, archives that breathe, and institutions that unlearn their literocentric habits. The library, seen through this lens, is not a monument but a metabolism — one that rots, regenerates, and keeps whispering its knowledge back to the soil.</p>

<i>Navsuv</i> offers a biweekly synthesis of my work: blog posts, critical notes, articles, archival documents, and other materials. It's not just a summary — it's an editorial thread tracing how each piece fits into a shifting landscape of memory, critique, and resistance.</p>
<p>
The name comes from the language of the Sivdara, a fictional people from a broader personal project I'm developing: a continent imagined as a space to explore knowledge, memory, and the tension between presence and erasure. In their tongue, <i>navsuv</i> names the rope-and-straw suspension bridges used to cross the naroow valleys, up in the mountains — ephemeral yet enduring paths stretched between worlds. Like this section.</p>
