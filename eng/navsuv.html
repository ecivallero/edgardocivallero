<h2>The Bi-Weekly Summary | 28.Jul-10.Aug.2025</h2>
<h3>Gates, Scaffolds, and Spines: The Architecture of Epistemic Power</h3>

<p>
What kinds of knowledge survive — and which are dismantled before they can speak? In recent weeks, my writing has traced a single thread through different territories, following the quiet machinery that governs the life and death of information.</p>
<p>
It begins at the threshold. The demand for a <a href="notes/n014-citation-required.html" title="Citation Required" target="_blank">citation</a> —that seemingly benign academic ritual— is, in truth, a toll gate. Without the right kind of paper, a story cannot pass. Whole worlds of oral, embodied, collective knowledge are stopped there, held at the border until they are translated into a format sanctioned by the dominant order. Many do not survive the crossing.</p>
<p>
But for those that do, another machine waits: the infrastructure of <a href="chronicles/c009-curating-biodiversity.html" title="Curating Biodiversity" target="_blank">metadata</a>. In biodiversity archives, in particular, this scaffolding promises interoperability, yet in its neat grids it strips knowledge of the ties that made it whole. Kinship becomes taxonomy. Territory becomes a set of coordinates. A plant that is a rain-bringer in one cosmology is reduced to a Latin binomial and a GPS point. The contexts are shaved away until the record can be exported, re-used, repurposed — and often re-owned.</p>
<p>
Behind that scaffolding lies the skeleton: the great <a href="blog/b053-the-colonial-spine-of-classification.html" title="The Colonial Spine of Classification" target="_blank">classificatory systems</a> —Dewey, UDC, LCSH— that hold up our libraries and databases. Their bones are colonial, carved to fit a particular worldview, and no amount of cosmetic repair changes their structure. You can rename a category, soften a heading, add a subdivision — but the spine remains the same, supporting a body that was never meant to hold all worlds equally.</p>
<p>
And at the end of this sequence comes <a href="blog/b052-to-curate-is-to-govern.html" title="To Curate is to Govern" target="_blank">curation</a> itself — the act that decides what enters the record and what is left outside. In biodiversity repositories as in cultural archives, curation is not simply keeping. It is ruling. To curate is to assert jurisdiction over life, to draw borders around meaning, to determine futures. Even now, in platforms that speak the language of openness, the logic of enclosure persists.</p>
<p>
From citation to curation, these are not neutral processes. They are the architecture of epistemic power: gates, scaffolds, spines, and borders. Recognizing them is not enough. We must also imagine other architectures — ones that carry the weight of our own worlds, built with other materials, by other hands.</p>

<i>Navsuv</i> offers a biweekly synthesis of my work: blog posts, critical notes, articles, archival documents, and other materials. It's not just a summary — it's an editorial thread tracing how each piece fits into a shifting landscape of memory, critique, and resistance.</p>
<p>
The name comes from the language of the Sivdara, a fictional people from a broader personal project I'm developing: a continent imagined as a space to explore knowledge, memory, and the tension between presence and erasure. In their tongue, <i>navsuv</i> names the rope-and-straw suspension bridges used to cross the naroow valleys, up in the mountains — ephemeral yet enduring paths stretched between worlds. Like this section.</p>
