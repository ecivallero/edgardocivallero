<h3>What We Archive, What We Erase</h3>

<p>
In the past two weeks, I've returned to a question that refuses to fade: What kinds of memory do we allow to live, and what kinds do we freeze, rename, or silence in the process of "preserving" them? This thread winds through four new pieces across my platforms, each tackling a different layer of this tension.</p>
<p>
It began with a pair of texts about living archives — systems of memory that don't reside on shelves or servers, but in rituals, gestures, seasonal speech, and embodied care. In <a href="blog/b050-when-memory-lives.html" title="When Memory Lives" target="_blank"><i>When Memory Lives</i></a> and <a href="chronicles/c008-building-the-living-archive.html" title="Building the Living Archive" target="_blank"><i>Building the Living Archive</i></a>, I explore what happens when knowledge refuses to be fixed. These aren't romantic metaphors: they're functioning epistemic systems that have survived colonization not through documentation, but through relationship and rhythm. To engage them meaningfully, libraries and archives must move beyond description, and learn to accompany memory in motion, not capture it into stillness.</p>
<p>
From there, the lens shifts toward the tools that shape visibility. In <a href="blog/b051-the-metadata-mirage.html" title="The Metadata Mirage" target="_blank"><i>The Metadata Mirage</i></a>, I pull apart the illusion of neutrality in structured description. Metadata doesn't just label what we see — it dictates what can be seen. Every field is a choice. Every omission is a map of institutional blind spots. And when those blind spots align with colonial hierarchies, what emerges is not just bad cataloging. It's epistemic infrastructure for forgetting.</p>
<p>
That forgetting isn't accidental. It's structural, as I argue in <a href="notes/n013-silenced-worlds.html" title="Silenced Worlds" target="_blank"><i>Silenced Worlds</i></a>, a note that critiques the literocentrism still embedded in our professional frameworks. We reward knowledge that sits nicely between quotation marks, and we marginalize anything that moves, breathes, or speaks in forms we were not trained to hear. The result is an archive that claims universality and delivers exclusion.</p>
<p>
Together, these four texts form a kind of call to memory work with a spine: a memory that resists being flattened, that challenges the tools meant to contain it, and that insists on its own logic of continuity. For those of us in libraries, archives, and museums —and for those outside them who carry, protect, or lose pieces of memory every day— the question isn't just what we keep.</p>
<p>
It's what we allow to matter, and who we allow to decide.</p>

<p>
<i>Navsuv</i> offers a biweekly synthesis of my work: blog posts, critical notes, articles, archival documents, and other materials. It's not just a summary — it's an editorial thread tracing how each piece fits into a shifting landscape of memory, critique, and resistance.</p>
<p>
The name comes from the language of the Sivdara, a fictional people from a broader personal project I'm developing: a continent imagined as a space to explore knowledge, memory, and the tension between presence and erasure. In their tongue, <i>navsuv</i> names the rope-and-straw suspension bridges used in the Andes — ephemeral yet enduring paths stretched between worlds. Like this section.</p>
