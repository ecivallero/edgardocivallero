Since their inception, my publishing projects have been driven by the need to create and share knowledge without barriers. Both El Zorro de Abajo Editora and Wayrachaki Editora were founded with the intention of offering open-access digital publications, challenging traditional publishing models and giving voice to stories, knowledge, and perspectives that are often left on the margins. These publishing houses reflect my commitment to memory, orality, music, and the sonic landscapes of Indigenous and Latin American communities, as well as my interest in knowledge management in alternative contexts.</p>

<h2 id="zorro">El Zorro de Abajo Editora</a></h2>
<p>
Founded in 2023, <i>El Zorro de Abajo Editora</i> ("The Fox from Below") continues and complements the work of <i>Wayrachaki Editora</i> (see below). Its objective is the production of books, primarily in digital format, distributed under open-access licenses. The publishing house specializes in content related to memory, orality, music, and traditional musical instruments, with a particular emphasis on the sounds and silences of Indigenous and Latin American peoples. </p>
<p>
The name of the publishing house comes from a short story included in the <i>Manuscript of Huarochirí</i>, a 17th-century work translated from Quechua into Spanish by José María Arguedas in 1966 (<i>Gods and Men of Huarochirí</i>). In chapter 5 of the manuscript, two foxes —one "from above" and one "from below"— meet on the slopes of Mount Latauzaco to exchange news about their communities. I chose the fox from below as the symbol of the publishing house because its story —an episode silenced about the miscarriage of a chief's daughter— was left unfinished in the original narrative, thus reflecting the need to give voice to marginalized stories. </p>

<h2 id="wayrachaki">Wayrachaki Editora</a></h2>
<p>
<i>Wayrachaki Editora</i> (from the Runasimi or Quechua <i>wayrachaki</i>, meaning "wind feet," that is, "wanderer," "nomad," or "drifter") was founded in 2007 in Córdoba, Argentina, at a time when independent publishing houses dedicated exclusively to digital and open-access publications were still uncommon. Under this imprint, I originally published my first works on <a href="books01.html" title="Digital books on Indigenous libraries">libraries in Indigenous communities</a>, which today form a collection of four digital books.</p>
<p>
Years later, the publishing house resumed its activity with the same spirit with which it was conceived: the publication of freely accessible digital books. Currently, <i>Wayrachaki Editora</i> encompasses a variety of content, including those related to knowledge and memory management and their associated disciplines. </p>

<h2>Publishing model</h2>
<p>
The publications of <i>El Zorro de Abajo Editora</i> and <i>Wayrachaki Editora</i> follow a completely independent and self-managed model. Each book is conceived, written, designed, and formatted entirely by me, ensuring full control over the content, aesthetics, and distribution.</p>
<p>
I chose this model because it grants me absolute freedom in the production and dissemination of knowledge, without relying on intermediaries or the constraints of the traditional publishing industry. Additionally, this approach ensures that knowledge is not trapped behind paywalls, facilitating its use in communities, libraries, and learning spaces. </p>
<p>
All books are published in digital format (PDF) and have an ISBN, ensuring their identification and registration in official bibliographic systems. </p>
<p>
The books are available for free download through my digital platforms, allowing direct and unrestricted access to interested readers. </p>
