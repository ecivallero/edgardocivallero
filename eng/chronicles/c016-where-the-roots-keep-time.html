<section>
<h3>
Time Without Clocks</h3>
<p>
In archival and library systems, time is typically rendered as sequence. Records are organized by date, version histories are tracked through incremental updates, and preservation strategies are oriented toward linear continuity. The implicit model is chronological progression: an ordered series of discrete states moving forward. Even when systems accommodate revision or branching, they do so through temporal markers that assume time is external to the record and measurable independently of its material condition.</p>
<p>
The subsoil of the cloud forest offers a different ontology. Beneath the canopy, roots do not register time as a sequence of moments but as alterations in structure. Flood, drought, compaction, nutrient scarcity, and microbial abundance are not archived as entries in a chronological log. They are inscribed in the thickness of root tissues, in the direction of growth, in the proliferation or suppression of lateral branches, and in the density of fine root hairs exploring new pockets of soil. Time is not appended to the organism as metadata; it is embedded in its morphology.</p>
<p>
This shift from numerical chronology to spatial embodiment has significant implications for archival thinking. If temporal experience can be stored as structural modification rather than as date-stamped sequence, then versioning, continuity, and historical depth could be reconsidered as properties of configuration rather than of enumeration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>
Subsoil Stratigraphy as Memory</h3>
<p>
Soil itself is a temporal medium. Horizons form through accumulation, leaching, decomposition, and compaction. Each layer is the result of interactions among climate, vegetation, microorganisms, and disturbance events. These layers are not simply sedimented deposits; they are chemically and biologically differentiated strata that reflect distinct regimes of water flow, oxygen availability, and organic input.</p>
<p>
Root systems interact with this stratigraphy dynamically. During prolonged drought, roots may extend deeper, altering their architecture to access subsoil moisture. In periods of flooding, oxygen deprivation can lead to root dieback in certain zones and compensatory growth in others. Grazing pressure or trampling compacts upper layers, redirecting root growth laterally. None of these responses is stored as a timestamp. Instead, the plant's body reorganizes itself in response to environmental pressure. The result is a three-dimensional record of stress, adaptation, and recurrence.</p>
<p>
From an ecosemiotic perspective, these structural adjustments function as temporal inscriptions. They encode not events in isolation, but patterns of recurrence and duration. A dense cluster of lateral roots in a specific horizon may indicate repeated seasonal waterlogging. A sudden change in root diameter may signal a shift in nutrient availability. These are not narrative accounts of the past; they are material correlates of it. Time, here, is legible only through spatial analysis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>
Compression and Recurrence</h3>
<p>
Archival versioning often presumes discrete stages: a document exists in state A, then B, then C. Even in more sophisticated models that incorporate branching or parallel development, the logic remains sequential. Each version replaces or supplements the previous one, and continuity is maintained through explicit documentation of change.</p>
<p>
In subsoil systems, change does not replace what came before; it compresses it. Earlier conditions persist as altered densities, as chemical residues, as microstructural differences within tissues. A period of nutrient abundance may produce a proliferation of fine roots that later decay but leave behind altered soil porosity and microbial communities. Subsequent growth takes place within that modified matrix. The past is not superseded — it is folded into the substrate in which new growth occurs.</p>
<p>
This model suggests a different understanding of archival depth. Rather than conceiving of versions as successive layers in a stack of replaceable states, we might understand them as interpenetrating modifications within a shared environment. A document's history of migration, annotation, and reformatting is not merely a list of events: it is a set of structural alterations that shape how it functions in the present. Temporal persistence becomes a matter of accumulated transformation rather than preserved identity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>
Temporal Density and Contextual Integrity</h3>
<p>
Roots also respond to density, both ecological and temporal. In crowded stands, competition for resources produces finer, more exploratory root systems. In stable, undisturbed environments, networks may thicken and interweave, reinforcing mutual support. These configurations reflect not single events but sustained conditions. Time is expressed as density of relation.</p>
<p>
Applied to memory institutions, this perspective reframes contextual integrity. Instead of treating context as a stable background against which records are placed, we can understand it as a dynamic field shaped by repeated interaction. A collection's temporal depth is not simply the span between its earliest and latest items; it is the density of relationships accumulated through use, citation, reinterpretation, and integration into new systems.</p>
<p>
Subsoil temporality thus challenges the assumption that historical continuity depends on preserving discrete, unaltered units. Continuity may instead reside in the capacity of a system to incorporate prior states into its present configuration. Just as a root system embodies past floods or droughts without isolating them as separate entities, an archive may embody its own transformations in the very structure of its metadata, access patterns, and descriptive layers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>
Rethinking Versioning as Depth</h3>
<p>
To conceive of versioning as depth rather than sequence is to shift from a procedural to a stratigraphic model of time. In the stratigraphic model, earlier states are not archived externally — they are sedimented within the current form. Compression does not eliminate difference — it reorganizes it spatially. Recurrence does not reset the system — it reinforces particular pathways of growth.</p>
<p>
Such a model aligns with the broader principles of ecosemiotic archivistics. Time becomes an ecological variable, not an external index. Memory persists through adaptation, not through stasis. The integrity of a record or system is measured not by its resistance to change but by its capacity to integrate change without collapse.</p>
<p>
Where roots keep time, they do so without clocks. They do not count years: they embody conditions. In their architecture, flood and drought coexist as modifications of depth and direction. Chronology is present, but it is inseparable from structure. If archives are to learn from ecological systems, they may need to treat time not as a line to be traced, but as a landscape to be inhabited.</p>
