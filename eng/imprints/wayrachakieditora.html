<h2>The imprint</h2>
<p>
Wayrachaki Editora (from runasimi or Quechua <i>wayrachaki</i>, "wind-feet," meaning "wanderer," "roamer," or "nomad") was founded in 2007 in Córdoba, Argentina, at a time when independent publishers dedicated exclusively to digital and open-access publications didn't exist. Under this imprint I released my first <a href="../books01.html" title="Books on libraries in Indigenous communities">works</a> on libraries in Indigenous communities, which today form a collection of four digital books.</p>
<p>
Years later, the imprint resumed activity with the same nomadic spirit that gave rise to it.</p>
<p>
We publish books that would never be accepted by an academic press. Texts that are born in the trenches, between cardboard boxes, in communities that invent libraries where there are no shelves or walls. Nor any need for books.</p>
<p>
Wayrachaki is not a business. It's a refuge from the structures that exclude. An emergency archive. Library militancy and archival activism: living memory, without permission, without academicism, without predetermined formats.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>What do we publish?</h2>
<p>
Downloadable texts with no commercial restrictions: essays, chronicles, manifestos, and above all, manuals. On libraries in resistance, archives at the margins, insurgent orality, situated classification, memory in crisis contexts, epistemologies of the South and of the deep South. On knowledge and memory. And on how information, really, is power.</p>
<p>
We do not publish theory without practice, politically correct positions, ivory tower discourse, or anything that smells like library neutrality. If it doesn't make someone uncomfortable, it doesn't get in.</p>
<p>
All titles are available on this page, along with a technical summary and download link.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Who is it for?</h2>
<p>
For those who build libraries, archives, reading rooms or whatever they can with mud, two wooden boxes, strings and words, or with zero budget, or through daily struggles that span decades. For professionals without degrees and students without careers. For archivists without archives and classifiers without systems.</p>
<p>
And for all those communities that don't always look for books — but always look for their memories, their territories, and their knowledge.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="line-header">
<strong>1. Line <i>Insurgent Epistemologies</i></strong><br>
<span class="line-tagline">
Editorial texts that resist stabilization, use, and closure.</span>
</p>

<details class="line-toggle">
<summary>(+) Line description</summary>
<p>
This line brings together works that examine how knowledge is produced, transmitted, protected, or denied under conditions of violence, erasure, and illegitimacy.</p>
<p>
These epistemologies are not theoretical models in the academic sense. They are operational systems of knowing that emerged in contexts where dominant institutions — schools, archives, libraries, states — were absent, hostile, or actively destructive. In these contexts, knowledge survived not through documentation, publication, or validation, but through silence, fragmentation, embodiment, secrecy, refusal, and relational continuity.</p>
<p>
<i>Insurgent Epistemologies</i> does not aim to diversify existing canons or propose "alternative perspectives" to be incorporated into them. It starts from a different premise: that many epistemic systems persist precisely because they were never designed to be visible, transferable, or recognized. Inclusion, in these cases, is not repair but risk.</p>
<p>
Each title in this line is grounded in a single epistemology — understood as a specific configuration of how knowledge is formed, how it circulates (or does not), what grants it legitimacy, and what political or ethical boundaries protect it.</p>
<p>
These epistemologies are not compared, reconciled, or synthesized. They are not stages of a process, nor elements of a framework. The line does not offer methods, applications, or prescriptions. It does not translate survival into pedagogy. Its purpose is editorial, not instructional: to name epistemic logics that operate outside dominant regimes of truth, and to document their internal coherence without forcing them into institutional formats they were never meant to inhabit.</p>
<p>
What appears here is not knowledge as it should be improved, expanded, or shared, but knowledge as it already functions under pressure, often at the cost of invisibility, silence, or illegitimacy.</p>

<strong>2. Line <i>Series Zero </i></strong><br>
<span class="line-tagline">
Texts that intervene before action becomes intrusion.</span>
</p>

<details class="line-toggle">
<summary>(+) Line description</summary>
<p>
<i>Series Zero</i> gathers texts that operate before librarianship, before institution, and before legitimacy.</p>
<p>
These manuals are not guides to action. They are devices of suspension. Each one intervenes at the moment when a person, a group, or a territory feels the impulse to "do something" — and asks whether that impulse is justified, necessary, or harmful.</p>
<p>
The series starts from a simple premise: not every situation requires a library, and not every desire to intervene is legitimate.</p>
<p>
<i>Series Zero</i> focuses on recognition rather than construction. Its manuals examine presence, absence, excess, timing, silence, and withdrawal as conditions of ethical action. They do not teach how to build, manage, or operate libraries. They ask how to recognize when one should wait, listen, step back, or even disappear.</p>
<p>
These texts are deliberately minimal in instruction and maximal in implication. They do not provide methodologies, workflows, or success criteria. Instead, they expose thresholds: moments when action becomes intrusion, when help becomes control, and when permanence becomes damage.</p>
<p>
The series treats stillness, doubt, and refusal not as failures, but as necessary competencies. It assumes that many of the most harmful interventions in the name of culture, education, or access happen precisely because no one paused to ask whether they were needed.</p>
<p>
<i>Series Zero</i> is finite by design. It is not a growing collection, nor a flexible framework. Its function is to unsettle certainty at the very beginning — and then get out of the way.</p>

<strong>3. Line <i>Libraries From Below</i>. Series <i>Basic Questions</i></strong><br>
<span class="line-tagline">
Structural questions that unsettle what we call a library.</span>
</p>

<details class="line-toggle">
<summary>(+) Line description</summary>
<p>
This series does not offer answers. It establishes the minimum questions that must be asked before calling something a library.</p>
<p>
<i>Series Basic Questions</i> exists to interrupt inherited assumptions from librarianship, education, and cultural policy. It starts from the recognition that many practices labeled as "libraries" reproduce forms of exclusion, extraction, and control precisely because their foundational questions were never examined.</p>
<p>
The questions gathered here are not introductory in the pedagogical sense. They are structural. Each one targets a decision point where power is exercised — often invisibly — over space, knowledge, memory, access, care, and responsibility.</p>
<p>
Rather than defining what a library is, this series examines how libraries come into being, who authorizes them, what they prioritize, and what forms of harm they may generate even when acting with good intentions. It treats libraries not as neutral institutions, but as arrangements of relationships, shaped by territory, history, inequality, and conflict.</p>
<p>
These questions are deliberately open-ended. They are not meant to be resolved conclusively, nor answered once and for all. Their function is to destabilize certainty, expose blind spots, and make visible the political and ethical dimensions of everyday library practice.</p>
<p>
This series is intended to be read slowly, out of sequence, and in tension with lived experience. If a question feels uncomfortable, unclear, or difficult to operationalize, that difficulty is not a flaw. It signals that something usually taken for granted is being brought into view.</p>

<strong>4. Line <i>Libraries From Below</i>. Series <i>Fundamental Manuals</i></strong><br>
<span class="line-tagline">
Constraints designed to prevent harm in library practice.</span>
</p>

<details class="line-toggle">
<summary>(+) Line description</summary>
<p>
This series does not teach how to run a library. It establishes the conditions under which any library action can avoid reproducing harm.</p>
<p>
The <i>Fundamental Manuals</i> address the structural dimensions of librarianship that are usually treated as technical, neutral, or merely operational. Cataloging, collections, space, literacy, evaluation, governance, documentation, and design are approached here not as tasks to be optimized, but as sites where power is exercised, often invisibly.</p>
<p>
These manuals are "basic" only in the sense that they deal with foundational decisions: decisions that shape who is recognized, who is excluded, what is preserved, how authority circulates, and how responsibility is distributed. They do not provide recipes, workflows, or best practices. They define limits, risks, and points of attention that apply regardless of context, scale, or resource level.</p>
<p>
Rather than asking <i>how</i> to do something, each manual asks what assumptions are being carried, what forms of harm are normalized, and what alternatives exist to institutional defaults.</p>
<p>
The series assumes that libraries do not become safer or more just by adding services, technologies, or programs, but by rethinking their underlying logics. It treats librarianship as a situated practice, shaped by territory, inequality, conflict, and history, rather than as a transferable professional model.</p>
<p>
These manuals are meant to be used across contexts, but not adapted lightly. They are not flexible toolkits; they are constraints. Their function is to slow down action, surface consequences, and prevent the uncritical reproduction of institutional violence in community settings.</p>

<strong>5. Line <i>Bastard Libraries</i>. Series <i>Survival Manuals</i></strong><br>
<span class="line-tagline">
Library practices under illegitimacy, scarcity, and threat.</span>
</p>

<details class="line-toggle">
<summary>(+) Line description</summary>
<p>
This series is written for situations where libraries exist without permission, without protection, and without the conditions that make professionalism possible.</p>
<p>
<i>Survival Manuals</i> does not assume stability, funding, infrastructure, safety, or recognition. It starts from contexts where libraries operate under scarcity, informality, conflict, surveillance, abandonment, or open hostility. In these conditions, survival is not heroic and practice is not neutral.</p>
<p>
The texts in this series are not aspirational. They do not describe ideal models or best practices. They document what actually works when legitimacy is absent, when rules are unclear or imposed from outside, and when institutional standards become obstacles rather than safeguards.</p>
<p>
This line rejects the fiction of the "proper" library. It treats illegitimacy not as a problem to be solved, but as a structural condition that shapes how knowledge is stored, shared, defended, or allowed to disappear. Professionalism, neutrality, and sustainability are approached critically, as concepts that often conceal relations of power, control, and capture.</p>
<p>
The series is internally differentiated. Each subgroup responds to a distinct survival condition: material scarcity, institutional refusal, economic pressure, undocumented memory, embodied harm, open violence, and childhood outside the cultural industry. These are not themes; they are operating environments.</p>
<p>
<i>Bastard Libraries</i> does not offer reassurance. It does not promise continuity, success, or recognition. It exists to make visible the techniques, compromises, refusals, and risks involved in keeping a library alive when being "proper" is no longer an option.</p>

<strong>6. Line <i>Bastard Libraries</i>. Series <i>Kits of Library Action</i></strong><br>
<span class="line-tagline">
Fragments designed for action under urgency and constraint.</span>
</p>

<details class="line-toggle">
<summary>(+) Line description</summary>
<p>
This series is designed for immediate use. The <i>Kits of Library Action</i> are not books to be read from beginning to end, nor manuals to be followed step by step. They are sets of fragments: cards, templates, prompts, diagrams, checklists, and minimal instructions meant to be activated in the moment, adapted on the ground, and discarded when no longer useful.</p>
<p>
Unlike the manuals in this line, the kits do not argue or explain. They assume urgency. They operate in contexts where time is limited, infrastructure is unstable, and decisions must be made without waiting for consensus, funding, or authorization.</p>
<p>
These kits are intentionally incomplete. They are not comprehensive solutions, strategic plans, or training materials. Their value lies in reducing friction: helping people act without having to invent everything from scratch, and without importing institutional tools that may not fit the context.</p>
<p>
Each kit isolates a single function — cataloging, lending, signage, documentation, repair, preservation, governance — and offers lightweight, low-dependency mechanisms that can function without electricity, connectivity, specialized equipment, or professional credentials.</p>
<p>
The series rejects standardization. None of the kits are meant to be implemented "correctly." They are designed to be modified, recombined, translated, and broken according to local needs and constraints.</p>

<strong>7. Line <i>Seeds of the Future</i>. Series <i>Manuals of Possibility</i></strong><br>
<span class="line-tagline">
Practices that continue under ecological and infrastructural limits.</span>
</p>

<details class="line-toggle">
<summary>(+) Line description</summary>
<p>
This series focuses on practices that remain viable when dominant systems can no longer be sustained.</p>
<p>
<i>Seeds of the Future</i> does not propose innovation, resilience, or scalable alternatives. It documents forms of continuation developed under ecological limits, social fragmentation, material scarcity, and infrastructural failure. The practices gathered here are not efficient, not replicable at scale, and often not compatible with institutional expectations. Their value lies precisely in that incompatibility.</p>
<p>
Each manual in this series starts from constraint rather than choice. The question guiding the line is not how to improve existing systems, but what continues when those systems break down, withdraw, or become harmful. Memory, care, and meaning are treated as fragile processes that must adapt to heat, humidity, exhaustion, distance, demographic change, and ecological pressure.</p>
<p>
This is not a future-oriented series in the speculative sense. It is grounded in present conditions already experienced in many territories: intermittent electricity, informal economies, aging populations, climate stress, and the erosion of public infrastructure. The manuals collected here do not imagine new worlds; they extend practices that already exist at the margins.</p>
<p>
The series is organized around three interconnected conditions: survival of memory without infrastructure, embodied and territorial practices, and low-energy forms of continuity shaped by post-growth realities. Together, they outline a librarianship that persists not by expansion or optimization, but by adaptation, reduction, and care under limits.</p>

<strong>8. Line <i>Seeds of the Future</i>. Series <i>Unbound Manuals</i></strong><br>

Editorial texts that resist stabilization, use, and closure.</span>
</p>

<details class="line-toggle">
<summary>(+) Line description</summary>
<p>
This series gathers texts that cannot be stabilized. <i>Unbound Manuals</i> are not manuals in the operational sense, nor speculative exercises, nor experimental literature disguised as theory. They are editorial interruptions: short-form works that question the very conditions under which libraries, archives, documents, and classification are assumed to exist.</p>
<p>
Unlike the other series, these texts are not designed to guide action, structure practice, or ensure continuity. They operate in moments of ambiguity, censorship, disappearance, affect, and contradiction. Their function is not to resolve problems, but to name what escapes resolution.</p>
<p>
The manuals in this series are intentionally volatile. They resist linear reading, practical application, and institutional framing. Some function as thought experiments, others as conceptual tools, and others as narrative devices. None of them aim for completeness, coherence, or durability.</p>
<p>
What unites them is not a shared method, but a shared refusal: the refusal to treat libraries as stable objects, memory as neutral material, or classification as a purely technical act. In this series, the library appears as rumor, absence, body, wound, fiction, and residue.</p>
<p>
<i>Unbound Manuals</i> does not propose alternatives to existing systems. It exposes the limits of system-building itself. These texts are meant to circulate lightly, to be read partially, misused, or abandoned. Their value lies in what they unsettle rather than in what they construct.</p>
