<h2>Why do we exist?</h2>
<p>
Wayrachaki Editora (from runasimi or Quechua <i>wayrachaki</i>, "wind-feet," meaning "wanderer," "roamer," or "nomad") was founded in 2007 in Córdoba, Argentina, at a time when independent publishers dedicated exclusively to digital and open-access publications didn't exist. Under this imprint I released my first <a href="../books01.html" title="Books on libraries in Indigenous communities">works</a> on libraries in Indigenous communities, which today form a collection of four digital books.</p>
<p>
Years later, the imprint resumed activity with the same nomadic spirit that gave rise to it.</p>
<p>
We publish books that would never be accepted by an academic press. Texts that are born in the trenches, between cardboard boxes, in communities that invent libraries where there are no shelves or walls. Nor any need for books.</p>
<p>
Wayrachaki is not a business. It's a refuge from the structures that exclude. An emergency archive. Library militancy and archival activism: living memory, without permission, without academicism, without predetermined formats.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>What do we publish?</h2>
<p>
Downloadable texts with no commercial restrictions: essays, chronicles, manifestos, and above all, manuals. On libraries in resistance, archives at the margins, insurgent orality, situated classification, memory in crisis contexts, epistemologies of the South and of the deep South. On knowledge and memory. And on how information, really, is power.</p>
<p>
We do not publish theory without practice, politically correct positions, ivory tower discourse, or anything that smells like library neutrality. If it doesn't make someone uncomfortable, it doesn't get in.</p>
<p>
All titles are available on this page, along with a technical summary and download link.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>How do we publish?</h2>
<p>
Each book is built by hand: from writing to design, through editing and publication. The entire process is self-managed, with available resources and no intermediaries.</p>
<p>
Almost always in PDF. Always with ISBN and a free license.</p>
<p>
Some follow the molds of the publishing sector. Others break them — because they weren't made to fit in; they were made to make noise.</p>
<p>
There are no committees. No filters. No calls for submissions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Who is it for?</h2>
<p>
For those who build libraries, archives, reading rooms or whatever they can with mud, two wooden boxes, strings and words, or with zero budget, or through daily struggles that span decades. For professionals without degrees and students without careers. For archivists without archives and classifiers without systems.</p>
<p>
And for all those communities that don't always look for books — but always look for their memories, their territories, and their knowledge.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
