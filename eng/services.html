<p class="subtitle">Overview</p>
<p>
I am a weaver of memories.</p>
<p>
I have 25 years of experience as a multifaceted professional, with a degree in Library Science and Documentation, specializing in Epistemologies of the South, a master's degree in Historical Archives and Memory, and training in music, editorial design, Marine Sciences, Biology, and History.</p>
<p>
I use my extensive experience in all traditional roles in information science and knowledge management, along with my research skills, to identify the threads with which human knowledge and memories are constructed. I also incorporate particular approaches, such as positions in critical and social librarianship and "rogue" archival practices, decolonizing perspectives, viewpoints from the margins, activism, resistances, and my own findings on natural sciences, traditional knowledge, cultural heritage, memory, identity, and sounds and silences, which I develop as a teacher, researcher, and writer.</p>
<p>
From that plural and interdisciplinary perspective, I use content production, translation, graphic design, and editorial correction to construct narratives that give meaning to my work. And I add all available technologies: from metadata, linked data, ontologies, semantic web, and knowledge classification to Digital Asset Management, digital preservation, data management and curation, programming, artificial intelligence, and IT solutions.</p>
<p>
Everything is useful for weaving memories. And in doing so, I place special emphasis on the intersection of libraries, archives, and museums as spaces for knowledge and memory management that should be one.</p>
<p>
As is human cultural heritage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subtitle">Experience</p>
<p>
My experience focuses on the intersection between critical and social librarianship, archival science, social justice, and new information technologies, from an interdisciplinary perspective. With a solid foundation in these fields, I contribute to a comprehensive understanding of knowledge and memory management, preservation, and access. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subtitle">Skills</p>
<p>
I possess a varied set of skills including knowledge management, research, technological proficiency, interdisciplinary and critical thinking, content production, translation, graphic design, editorial skills, and communication. These abilities allow me to navigate effectively through rich and complex landscapes of knowledge and memory and to create meaningful narratives from them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subtitle">Value</p>
<p>
I offer my users and clients a valuable experience in information management, cultural heritage preservation, interdisciplinary perspectives, meaningful narrative construction, technological integration, and language and communication skills. My commitment to social justice and equity, grounded in knowledge- and memory-based principles, ensures that my work remains ethically grounded and has a social impact.</p>
