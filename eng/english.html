<p class="subtitle"><a name="about">About the site</a></p>
<p>Inaugurated in August 2022, this website compiles a series of professional and other content that I have been producing since 2000. These works have been presented online through various platforms, with a focus on blogs, digital magazines, columns, and social networks. Simultaneously, the website serves as a platform for both present and future publications within my areas of interest.</p>
<p>In the <a href="#pubs" title="Publications" alt="Publications">publications</a> section, I provide information on platforms, archives, and other storage spaces for my intellectual production. Meanwhile, in my <a href="#blogs" title="Blogs" alt="Blogs">blogs</a> I continue to write periodically.</p>
<p>All content related to music and (ethno)musicology has been relocated to the website <a href="https://www.instru-mentarium.org/2019/12/instrumentarium-in-english-homepage.html" target="_blank" alt="Instrumentarium" title="Instrumentarium"><i>Instrumentarium</i></a> (mostly in Spanish).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subtitle"><a name="blogs">Blogs</a></p>
<p>The site hosts a Spanish-language blog on <a href="../blog.html" title="Blog Bitácora de un bibliotecario" alt="Blog Bitácora de un bibliotecario">libraries and archives</a>, titled "Bitácora de un bibliotecario." Additionally, there is also an English-language space hosted on Medium, called <a href="https://medium.com/libraries-in-the-margins" target="_blank" title="Libraries in the margins" alt="Libraries in the margins"><i>Libraries in the margins</i></a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subtitle"><a name="author">The author</a></p>
<p>I am a multifaceted professional with 25 years of experience and a native of Puerto de Santa María de los Buenos Aires (1973). I became a librarian in 1999 and, in 2004, graduated in Library Science and Documentation at the National University of Córdoba (Argentina). There I also studied Biology and History (Anthropology and Archaeology), although long before that, I had studied Marine Sciences at the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (Spain). After a long and varied professional career (which includes a specialization in Epistemologies of the South, a master's degree in Historical Archiving and Memory, and diplomas, master's, and doctoral degrees in progress), since 2024 I live between Panama (where I supervise the library of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute) and Bogotá (Colombia), where I work as a consultant on a wide variety of knowledge and memory management and content production projects.</p>
<p>I specialize in metadata, Digital Asset Management, digital preservation, data management and curation, programming, artificial intelligence, and IT solutions. As a teacher, researcher, lecturer, and popular writer, I work with natural sciences, traditional knowledge, cultural heritage, memory and identity, sounds and silences, musical instruments, audiovisual collections, and musical bibliographic research, and with the dialogue between libraries, archives, and museums to build new knowledge and recover old stories.</p>
<p>Throughout my career, I have acquired extensive experience in critical and social librarianship; in working with libraries on the margins; in the management of traditional knowledge, oral tradition, and endangered sounds (languages and music); and in the design of library services for indigenous societies and other "subaltern" groups. In addition to the traditional roles in information science, I also work with knowledge classification, semantic web, and construction of documentary languages, vocabularies, ontologies, and metadata. And to all that, I add my work with library design and library services, collection management, decolonization, grassroots library development (rural, neighborhood, community, school, popular) and mobile libraries, open access, copyright / copyleft, open source in librarianship (DSpace, Koha, OJS3), non-European book history, reading promotion, digital humanities, and qualitative research.</p>
<p>I understand and defend the library as a committed space of activism and socio-political militancy, and of cultural, identity, and collective resistance.</p>
<p>My work in the Galapagos Islands (2018-2023) linked me to fields such as the history and memory of science, open science, e-research, biodiversity and environmental conservation, citizen science, biomimicry, sustainability and degrowth, as well as knowledge mobilization, communication, outreach and environmental education, and preservation, conservation, and digitization of heritage collections.</p>
<p>Since 2004, I have been part of several IFLA sections and groups, worked with the UDC (Universal Decimal Classification) Consortium, participated in several editorial committees and digital spaces for research and debate, given classes and lectures, and written outreach texts on the topics of my interest, which I publish through my independent publishing house El Zorro de Abajo Editora (formerly Wayrachaki Editora).</p>
<p>In addition to being a librarian, I am a musician: a multi-instrumentalist acceptable at everything and virtuoso at nothing, a performer of traditional Latin American and European music. I am interested in the sounds and silences of the world and the many stories they tell, and I feel a special inclination towards the relationship of that sound heritage with memory and identity. I research and share the results through a wide series of digital outreach publications, compose and perform music, build instruments, explore other sound horizons, and create new personal research projects online.</p>
<p>Beyond libraries and music, I am a proofreader, translator, and editorial designer, an old print worker, an avid language learner, a frustrated fiction writer, a blogger with 20 years of experience behind me, a Wikipedian and Esperantist, an apprentice citizen scientist, a cartoonist and photographer, and a puppet builder.</p>

<p class="subtitle"><a name="contact">Contact & networks</a></p>
<p>For contact, you can reach me via email at edgardocivallero [at] gmail [dot] com. You can also find me on various social networks; direct links to these profiles are available in the bottom bar of this page (mostly in Spanish).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subtitle"><a name="pubs">Publications, platforms, & academic networks</a></p> 
<p>All my publications, including digital books, articles, conferences, courses, pre-prints, compilations of blog posts, and informative texts, are stored in <a href="https://archive.org/details/@ecivallero" target="_blank" title="Archive.org" alt="Archive.org">Archive.org</a>, in the Argentinean open-access repository <a href="https://www.aacademica.org/edgardo.civallero" target="_blank" title="Acta Académica" alt="Acta Académica">Acta Académica</a>, and in the folder "Publicaciones" of my space on <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qFxKgIsZBTJw5j_xFkgLuCZPi7_MMZVR?usp=sharing" target="_blank" title="GoogleDrive" alt="GoogleDrive">GoogleDrive</a>.</p>
<p>A handful of those texts are also in the open-access archive <a href="https://repository.arizona.edu/browse?value=Civallero%2C+Edgardo&type=author" target="_blank" title="DLIST" alt="DLIST">DLIST</a>, of the University of Arizona (USA). Although in the past, all my materials were presented on E-LIS, they were removed from there around 2016 due to strong differences with the structure and management model of that space.</p>
<p>Among my publications, there are <a href="libros01.html" alt="Digital books on indigenous libraries" title="Digital books on indigenous libraries">digital books</a> on indigenous libraries (link in Spanish); digital books on music and musical instruments <a href="https://www.instru-mentarium.org/2022/10/instrumentarium-libros-digitales-sobre.html" target="_blank" alt="Digital books on music" title="Digital books on music">in Spanish</a> and <a href="https://www.instru-mentarium.org/2022/10/instrumentarium-digital-books-on-music.html" target="_blank" alt="Digital books on music" title="Digital books on music">in English</a>; <a href="https://www.instru-mentarium.org/2022/10/instrumentarium-articulos-sobre-musica.html" target="_blank" alt="Articles on music" title="Articles on music">articles</a> on music and musical instruments (link in Spanish); <a href="libros03.html" alt="Photography books" title="Photography books">photography books</a> (link in Spanish); and a series of <a href="libros02.html" alt="Fiction works" title="Fiction works">fiction works</a> (link in Spanish).</p>
<p>From 2007 to 2022, a good part of my digital books were published through my old independent publishing house Wayrachaki Editora, a personal initiative which today is continued by <a href="editorial.html" title="El Zorro de Abajo Editora" alt="El Zorro de Abajo Editora">El Zorro de Abajo Editora</a> (link in Spanish).</p>
<p>Most of my intellectual production is also stored on three platforms that are popular but somewhat debated due to their working model: <a href="http://issuu.com/edgardo-civallero/" target="_blank" title="Issuu" alt="Issuu">Issuu</a>, <a href="https://es.scribd.com/edcivallero" target="_blank" title="Scribd" alt="Scribd">Scribd</a>, and <a href="http://es.calameo.com/accounts/4163651" target="_blank" title="Calameo" alt="Calameo">Calaméo</a>.</p>
<p>I also belong to a number of academic networks. In three of them, I present and share, as in those mentioned above, most of my publications: <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MbiuWvUAAAAJ" target="_blank" title="Google Scholar" alt="Google Scholar">Google Scholar</a>, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Edgardo_Civallero" target="_blank" title="Research Gate" alt="Research Gate">Research Gate</a>, and <a href="https://independent.academia.edu/EdCivallero" target="_blank" title="Academia.edu" alt="Academia.edu">Academia.edu</a>. These have also been strongly debated for their ethical principles and action models; however, they present a series of utilities that are beneficial.</p>
<p>Finally, I participate in other academic-professional structures, such as <a href="https://www.webofscience.com/wos/author/record/656150" target="_blank" title="Web of Science" alt="Web of Science">Web of Science</a>, <a href="https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56254900700" target="_blank" title="Scopus" alt="Scopus">Scopus</a>, <a href="https://www.mendeley.com/search/?page=1&query=edgardo%20civallero" target="_blank" title="Mendeley" alt="Mendeley">Mendeley</a>, and <a href="https://www.zotero.org/edgardocivallero" target="_blank" title="Zotero" alt="Zotero">Zotero</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subtitle"><a name="activities">Activities</a></p>
<p>I develop my Library and Information Science (LIS)-related teaching work (both in-person and virtual instances) around most of the topics that constitute conventional Library & Information Sciences, as taught in a standard university curriculum. In addition, I incorporate the more social facets of the profession, such as critical and "trench" libraries, and those situated "in the margins." I also engage in memory-related activities, including oral tradition, traditional knowledge, areas of contact between libraries/information and biological and environmental sciences, and the realm of data management.</p>
<p>Among the potential activities to be developed (courses, workshops, and/or seminars), I offer the "Librarianship for Non-Librarians" series (covering a broad range of content, from acquisition to cataloging and classification, through policy design and reading promotion), the "Trench Libraries" series (tailored for unconventional libraries or those operating in complex spaces), the "Decolonizing Libraries" series (addressing library work from the <i>Epistemologías del Sur</i> / Southern Epistemologies' perspective), the "Libraries and Biosphere" series (exploring citizen science, sustainability, growth, "green" libraries, Agenda 2030), and the "Libraries from Scratch" series (aimed at those starting a library). Additionally, I work with ontologies and thesaurus building, knowledge classification, data management, and semantic web.</p>
<p>Finally, I teach courses, workshops, and/or seminars on the collection and management of oral tradition and threatened sounds (languages and music, especially indigenous), as well as the organization of library services for indigenous societies and "minority" populations.</p>

<p class="subtitle"><a name="history">History</a></p>
<p>I embarked on my online journey with "Bitácora de un bibliotecario," which started operating on December 2, 2004, as one of the first Latin American/Spanish-language weblogs on libraries and librarians. At that time, fresh from completing my degree in Library Science and Documentation, I shared my reflections on my concerns, discoveries, illusions, disappointments, struggles, and encounters. Between 2005 and 2008, I maintained a parallel English version, "The log of a librarian." The posts became sporadic after 2009, and in 2014, I decided to close the original "Bitacora...", marking the end of a chapter in my personal and professional life.</p>
<p>Gaining perspective from the years and the journey, armed with the lessons accumulated, I opened a new blog in 2015, simply titled "Bibliotecario," inheriting and continuing many works, ideas, and values from its predecessor. This space was active until 2022. Simultaneously, I delved into specialized blogs related to library sciences, including spaces dedicated to indigenous libraries ("Bibliotecas y pueblos originarios," "Bibliotecas indígenas"), orality ("Tradición oral"), and indigenous languages ("Palabra indígena").</p>
<p>Additionally, I explored topics in ethnomusicology, traditional sounds, and musical instruments through blogs such as "Bitácora de un músico," "Un Sur de sonidos," "Sonidos de Abya Yala," "Vientos de tierra de vientos" (a self-produced Andean music CD), and "Sonidos y silencios." This area also encompassed parallel spaces, like the digital magazine of Andean music and culture, "Tierra de vientos," or the "Aula abierta de música tradicional."</p>
<p>As a writer, I maintained a space called "Bitácora de un escritor" and individual blogs for my various literary works, including "Crónicas de la Serpiente Emplumada," "Espíritus del Viento," and "El Ekeko."</p>
<p>The multitude of spaces became challenging to sustain, gradually consolidating all contents on this site, presenting products in their plural context, intertwining and dialoguing with each other.</p>
