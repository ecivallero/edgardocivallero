<h1><span class="section-number">1</span>A place to begin</h1>
<p>
Welcome! My name is <a href="profile.html#author" title="The author">Edgardo Civallero</a>. I write from the mist — from the cloud forest and páramo of Cundinamarca, Colombia. I'm a librarian, archivist, musician, writer, and visual artist — and work as a semantic consultant, researcher, editor, designer, speaker, teacher, naturalist, and memory weaver.</p>
<p>
This site brings together my work across librarianship, archives, sound, visual arts, biology / ecology, and the stewardship of knowledge and memory — fields where information braids with silence, research touches rot, and musical instruments (and sometimes the puppets from my workshop) argue with metadata.</p>
<p>
Use the sidebar to navigate by theme. Browse, read, wander. And if any thread hums back to you — write to me. May your path be a good one.</p>

<h2><b>Metadata as Revolt (09 of 10) | Infrastructures of Accountability</b></h2>
<p><small>Published February 17, 2026</small></p>
<p>
The latest post on my blog <a href="blog.html" title="The Log of a Librarian"><i>The Log of a Librarian</i></a>, part of the ongoing series <i>Metadata as Revolt</i>, is titled "<a href="blog/b066-infrastructures-of-accountability.html" title="Infrastructures of Accountability">Infrastructures of Accountability</a>." The essay moves the series from critique to construction, asking what follows once metadata infrastructures are decentralized and authority becomes distributed. If plurality is achieved, how is it governed? Who introduces terms, who revises them, and under what conditions of authorization?</p>
<p>
Drawing on models of provenance, version control, and semantic governance, the piece argues that alternative metadata systems cannot rely on intention alone. They must document their own processes of change. Metadata, treated not as neutral description but as political interface, must make visible the agents, decisions, and consent frameworks that sustain its evolution.</p>

<h2><b>A log of recent writings, sounds, and gestures</b></h2>
<p><small>Published February 15, 2026</small></p>
<p>
In the las two weeks (February2 to 15) I've been writing through a sequence of questions that kept returning, each time from a different place.</p>
<p>
It began with <a href="blog/b064-metadata-as-mediation.html"><i>Metadata as Mediation</i></a>, where I tried to articulate how meaning moves between systems without being flattened, and how translation itself becomes an act of responsibility rather than a technical afterthought. That line of thought then pushed me out of infrastructure and into terrain, in <a href="blog/b065-meaning-that-is-lost-when-uprooted.html"><i>Meaning That Is Lost When Uprooted</i></a>, where the problem ceased to be semantic and became ecological: what kinds of memory simply collapse when removed from the conditions that make them legible.</p>
<p>
From there, writing could no longer remain abstract. <a href="chronicles/c015-the-cloud-forest-does-not-archive.html"><i>The Cloud Forest Does Not Archive</i></a> was written from inside that realization, using the forest itself to think through forms of memory that persist only through rhythm, moisture, and presence, and that resist every logic of fixation. The sequence closes, for now, by turning back toward libraries and their habits, in <a href="notes/n020-the-page-cannot-hold-the-dance.html"><i>The Page Cannot Hold the Dance</i></a>, where the question becomes unavoidable: what kinds of knowledge will continue to be lost as long as we insist that everything worth remembering must fit on a page.</p>

<h2><b>Upcoming writings, events, and works-in-progress</b></h2>
<p><small>Published February 15, 2026</small></p>
<p>
Over the coming months, new threads will begin to surface here — if conditions allow.</p>
<p>
One of them is the relaunch of <a href="wayrachakieditora.html" title="Wayrachaki Editora"><i>Wayrachaki Editora</i></a>, an independent imprint devoted to open-access digital books written from the margins: manuals, chronicles, and editorial texts on libraries in resistance, insurgent orality, fragile archives, and knowledge practices shaped by conflict, scarcity, and territory. The imprint resumes its work with the same nomadic spirit that first gave it form, publishing texts that would never survive academic vetting and were never meant to.</p>
<p>
Another thread takes shape through <a href="https://teladearania.com/english.html" target="_blank" title="Tela de Araña"><i>Tela de Araña</i></a>, a set of consulting and advisory services focused on semantic design, metadata systems, community archives, and knowledge infrastructures where conventional models fail. This work unfolds slowly and situationally, through accompaniment rather than solutions, and will be documented here as it happens.</p>
<p>
Alongside these developments, the chronicles, notes, and essays will continue. Writing will keep moving between forests and libraries, between theory and ground, following questions as they arise rather than as they are planned. Nothing here is scheduled in advance. Some things will arrive quietly. Others may never appear.</p>
<p>
Fog, after all, has its own timing.</p>

<h2><b>Archive of published works and recorded materials</b></h2>
<p><small>Published February 15, 2026</small></p>
<p>
If you're curious about a different side of my work, you can also wander over to <a href="https://www.instru-mentarium.org/eng/english.html" target="_blank" title="Instrumentarium"><i>Instrumentarium</i></a>. That's where I focus on sound: traditional musical instruments, listening, field notes, and music. You'll find books you can download, blog posts, and some recordings — things that make more sense when they're heard, touched, or followed over time, rather than read straight through.</p>
